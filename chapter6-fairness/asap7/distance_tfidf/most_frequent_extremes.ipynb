I was being very patient at the time. I had called my @CAPS4's, @CAPS5's, sister's and brother's to fave me. @CAPS14 they said they were busy so l cried myself to sleep. The next @NUM1 days my mom and dad was talking about going to the movies and out to dinner. I walked in screaming and yelling \"@CAPS6 ARE @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 AND @CAPS10 A @CAPS11 AND @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS7 @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS9 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 OWN @CAPS21\" @CAPS22 I left out the room. The very next day my brother and his girlfriend went to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 it knowing l wanted to @CAPS9. They came home reasing me saying @CAPS6 good the @CAPS11 was. So that night l went down stairs to demand to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 \"@CAPS2\" saying \" I am being very patient with you all about taking me to @CAPS10 @CAPS2 @CAPS14 you all are pushing my buttons so l demand to @CAPS9 tomarrow\" @CAPS22 I waited @NUM2 second @CAPS22 she said that l could @CAPS9 this @DATE2. That was the very @NUM3 time that l was patient, and I'm proud of myself, I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 wait to @CAPS10 my @CAPS25 @PERSON1 @CAPS26\"\n"
