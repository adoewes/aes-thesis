"I am going to write a story about a tim e that I was patient. When I was eleven, on @DATE1 my mother was due to have her baby. I couldn∆t wait I was so excited. We went to the doctors officeand we shifted into her room. (me and  @CAPS1 my mom∆s best friend) and @CAPS2 her. When we got into the room my mother was having contractions,she was yelling, screaming and squeezing my dads hand. I got scared while she was yelling and I didn∆t want her to get hurt. I walked out of the room and me and @CAPS1 went and got the baby @PERSON1 her first dress. The baby came home she was always crying  thats when I learned to be patient holding babys ."
