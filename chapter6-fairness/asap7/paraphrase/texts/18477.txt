Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 and I was getting antsy. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so I decide to be patient and read. Before I knew it we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining I stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.
