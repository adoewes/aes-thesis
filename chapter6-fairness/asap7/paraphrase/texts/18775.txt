"HereÆs a story about time when I was patient. So the story begins at art prize and loved to see the beautiful art there, but I was dieing to see the winnig picture for art prize. My parent told me to wait until we all see the rest of the art prize amazing art. So I signed and replyed ok we can see the rest of the art prize things first.  While we were looking at the art the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That is all I thought about. ??? A little bit later. I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at art prize. So I checied up and disieded patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while it all of a sodden it seems more valuable.  A couple hours later I started to head to the car, and my mom intrupted and said, ô@CAPS1 donÆt you want to see the winning piece of art?ö ô@CAPS2 yes I forget.ö@CAPS3 there is not a line now so when we go to see it there was no line. I was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of sergeants drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patient is important, because that way it was worth the wait to see something that you like."
