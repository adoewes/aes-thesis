"Patience is a  feeling that you get when you experience  are difficult task and do your best to  overcome it without  complaining about the task, like when your getting paint out and then  you  squeeze  it and it won∆t come out, but you still keep trying until you figure out that  it is gone.  Then you go get a new bottle to start using. I wish that more people were patient, then we wouldn∆t gave to listens to constant complaining."
