I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctors office with my mom because I wasnÆt feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said ô@CAPS1 itÆs already been ten minutesö ôI wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor.ö I said. ôI donÆ.t know but lets wait a bit longer. Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I signed. What is taking so long? I wandered. Was my doctor even here today? I starred at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. ô@CAPS1 itÆs almost @NUM1!ö ô@CAPS2!ö I said flustered and annoyed. ôAre we just gonna sit here all day?ö I asked. Finally my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. ô@CAPS3 for being patient! the nurse said smilling. I smiled back. I @CAPS4 been patient.
