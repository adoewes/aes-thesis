"A time when I was patient well it didn∆t just happened once it happends all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just don∆t go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I don∆t complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. Then shop for jewlery make up perfume and every woman item known to the world. Plus I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion I am very patient for my mother no matter what."
