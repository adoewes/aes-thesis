"This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1.There was a huge camp ground were you can reserve an area and camp there.The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away. So i packed a magazine, some  paper my @CAPS1 and decided the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour but as @CAPS4 played all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didnÆt know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour.  When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2 said @CAPS4 are here kids!ö ô@CAPS3!ö @CAPS4 all @CAPS5. @CAPS4 set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it. But the ride home seemed alot quicker. Tthat is the story of a time I was patient"
