"One time I had to use patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 ocklock @CAPS2 time and,in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am.  I was very tired of being patient, IÆm not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!"
