"One time me and my family were at @CAPS1 point over the @DATE1. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didn∆t feel like it. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool so my dad and I ran over to the entrance, but when we got their the wait time on the board said one hour and fortyfive minutes. I really wanted to go on this ride but really wasn∆t worth standing in that line. So when the line started moving and we were half way their the signs said @NUM1 minutes. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that we∆ll be trough soon and he told me for just watch the people on it go by and not talk. We moved up only a little and the time was at @NUM1 minutes, so my dad said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister."
