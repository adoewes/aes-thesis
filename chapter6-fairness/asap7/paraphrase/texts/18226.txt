"We were driving to @LOCATION1. My uncle lived there so since he always came to our house we were going to his new house. I was excited about going there, but there was one problem, it was over a ten hour drive. My parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and I felt so tired. I looked at the clock and it said six thirty a.m. I knew we weren't bringing a lot of food and things so we went to get packed up and in the van but it took longer that it seemed like it would last. My dad said we would leave around seven thirty but it was an hour more that we planned. We got all packed up and we were onthe road. It was about an hour in I fell asleep in the back seat. We made a stop an hour and @DATE1 and I woke up. After we got back me and my bother watched a movie on our portable dvd player. We kept driving there and I knew it would take a while but I kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. When we got there @DATE1 it was great. Their house was up in a mountain, I had fan visiting them and we walked around town went into stores.  I had fun seeing my uncle and aunt. This was the time I was patient."
