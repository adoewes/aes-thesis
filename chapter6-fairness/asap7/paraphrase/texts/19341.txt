Patients  to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time.
