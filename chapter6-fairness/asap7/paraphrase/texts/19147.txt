This one time my brother and I were coming back from @LOCATION1. Everything was fine until the car broke down on the free way. So we called our parents to come get us. Well when they got there they forgot the cabols. So just as they were getting to us they left. So @NUM1 hours went by hear they come. I said did you remember to get every thing. They shook their head yes hooked up the car and a way we went.
