"Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you donÆt. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldnÆt stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over ôstiff upper lip.ö I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didnÆt work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. ôI want to go homeö I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said ô@CAPS2ö all grouchy. I had sniffled and said ôI want to come home, I miss you.ö and sniffled more. ôSomeone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.ö @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1Æs car. ô@CAPS4 didnÆt you want to stay?ö @PERSON5 asked calmly. ôI donÆt know.ö And it wasnÆt brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks."
