The time I was patient was last @DATE1 when we went to the cedar point. When we went to cedar point there was a long line when we got to the front of the line the machine broke. @CAPS1 we had to go to a nother ride and I couldn∆t wait @CAPS1 long because I had to go to the bathroom @CAPS1 I walked out of line and went to the bathroom. When I came back there were more people in line @CAPS1 I just waited.
