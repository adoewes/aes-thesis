"Today I∆@CAPS3 going to write about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, there I came back an hour later and she was still there she is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On test(like @CAPS3.E.A.P) she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha and her last name is @CAPS2). At the @ORGANIZATION1 she doesn∆t await in a long line for a corn dog.Now I∆@CAPS3 starting to think that @CAPS1 enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn∆t mind to wait for me when I have to do something."
