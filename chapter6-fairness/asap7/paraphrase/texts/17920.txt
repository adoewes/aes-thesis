"One time I was patient when I was in @LOCATION1 getting on a ride called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 parents @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 was a @CAPS5 long line and I'm usually saying ""@CAPS6 on!"" Or sometimes ""@CAPS7's go!"" @CAPS8, I was being @CAPS5 patient in the line. I was proud of my self and so was my mom. That was the time I was being patient."
