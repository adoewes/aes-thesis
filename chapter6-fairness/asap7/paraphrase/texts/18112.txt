"The first time I baby sat was with @NUM1 little girls. A toddler named @PERSON1 and a baby named @CAPS1. After their parents left, everything was fine. That is, @CAPS4 @CAPS1 started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, ô@CAPS3, @CAPS3!ö @CAPS4 I realized she was saying, ô@CAPS5, @CAPS5!ö. Her @CAPS5 is a blanket and when I handed it to her, she stopped immeadiently! Now I realize how patient I was with her. IÆm glad I figured out what she wanted. Hopefully, next time IÆll be just as patient."
