I felt a thrill in my body. We were @NUM1 seconds from the opening of @ORGANIZATION1. I had to wait @NUM2 minutes to go on space mountain. I wish I could∆ve cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it. A the end of the day I beged to go on one more ride. Again I had to wait @NUM3 minutes to go on. The ride showed boring history of @CAPS1. Then at the end it gave us a screen and we picked the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it.
