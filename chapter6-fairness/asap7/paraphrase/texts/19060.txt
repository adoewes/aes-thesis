It takes patience when you are out hunting. After about @NUM1 deer seasons my patience paryed off. I was using a bow and ran @NUM2 point walked out. He was about @NUM3 yards from my stand and I called him closer. Then he was @NUM4 yards from my stand. I took the shot and he buckled and the @NUM5 minutes I waited to find him felt like in life time. Then I got out of my stand he ran about @NUM6 yards and droped. When I got to him. I was so excited because he wasn't won @NUM2 point he was a @NUM8 point back. Do remember use the regin blood head and be patient you could shoot the deer of a lifetime.
