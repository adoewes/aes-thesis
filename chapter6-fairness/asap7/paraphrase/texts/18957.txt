"Sometime it can be hard to be patient, @CAPS1 me it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C.I had just turned @NUM1 and was going to meet president @PERSON1 face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the white house a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around @NUM2 then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited played hangman and saws other @CAPS3. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Around @NUM1:30pm @PERSON1 came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?""I said ""yes""à.we went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry @CAPS1 having to wait, but I didn't care it care it was worth it."
