"When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car from the @NUM1 hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw at cedar point, the amusement park. In the car we talked about the @CAPS1.  The maverick, milleniur force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the mentis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the @CAPS1. As we approach the @CAPS4 we see at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the @CAPS2 the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a @NUM4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and leard waiting leads up to good things."
