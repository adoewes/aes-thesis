"Did you know that patients are one of the key to happiness. For an example I was walking and @CAPS1 this guy walked up. To and started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasnÆt very patient at the time.) @CAPS1 he kept going on and on until I snaped and said ôdo you know to shut upö! badly he said ôyesö @CAPS1 ran home., crying. @CAPS1 I went home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, @CAPS1 said ôsorryö.! And for some reason he said ôgot youö I said ôwhatö I was so mad but I was happy when it was over. But that taught me a lesson though, always be patient because you don`t know who watching, literally."
