"Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people don∆t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don∆t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn∆t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn∆t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I∆m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs."
