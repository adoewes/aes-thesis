"There was a time when I was patience and I was waiting for a long time me my cousin, @PERSON1 was walking around town and we was looking for silly bans ok first we went to the @DATE1 store but when we got there they was closed so we started walking again and then we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1 they was on bikes and we walk so then @CAPS1 said it∆s a @PERSON2 store down there so walk down there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and see how much they casy and they coats @MONEY1 and some of them coat @MONEY2 so we went to @PERSON2 tree and they was a @MONEY3 but we didn∆t get them because @PERSON1 didn∆t like the ones they had so we went all over the when we found them she didn∆t want them. So we went to my grandma house and she asked me where we was all day and I said we was out looking for some dom silly bans. And my grandma said don∆t go where @PERSON1 want to go. If your mama tell you to come over here come over here and I was trying to be patience by not trying to yell at @LOCATION1."
