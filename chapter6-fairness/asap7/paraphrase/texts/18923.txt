"It  was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1 and the @NUM1  and @NUM2 grade football teams were playing at  different  times one at @NUM3 and one at @NUM4 and of course there was @CAPS1 leaders, and I just happened  to be one of them. The game starts at about @NUM3 o∆clock and we started cheering. After about @NUM3:15 we were getting very cold we were wareing our warm-ups but we were still cold. So now that we were cold we were  getting kind of cranky. As half time came it was even colder. We all took a brake and went and got some hot chocolate. Well of corse  we were in a hurry to get back to the  bleachers to sit down, well I started to walk faster and faster then I dropped my hot cholate  down the front of me. Well I was mad but I∆m a @CAPS1 leader so I have to be happy. Then we started cheering again and it was colder than when we started but we just kept cheering but then some of the @CAPS1 leaders decided they wanted to take off there warm-ups and if more pepole want to take them off well all have  to take them off so we did. And we froze  but we held in there until the @NUM7 game was over. Then we all went home and probubly went to bed."
