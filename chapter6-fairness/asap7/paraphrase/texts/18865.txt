"One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you don∆t know what that is I∆ll tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesn∆t have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met."
