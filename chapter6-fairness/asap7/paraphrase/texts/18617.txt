"There is this little patience I use a lot go I called it hunting patience. On @DATE1 my dad and I were hunting in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. we got into our stands baking over a @NUM1 yard bean feild, and not @NUM2 hours later two does walked in from our left they were coming close to @CAPS2. I was about to draw my bow when I look around and saw my dad waiting for @CAPS2 to shoot but when I look in the forest conner of our field I saw a big six point buck standing there not moving. I decied to be patient and see if the buck would come in. I saw I deer move into my blind spot where I couldn∆t see it, I thought it might leave like that buck last year in my blind spot too. I waited for @NUM3 minutes, just when I thought he left I saw him again coming right for us. It was at @NUM4 then @NUM5 then @NUM6 and stopped. I looked at my dad and nodded to give him the sign to shoot. He under stood drew back his bow and let that arrow fly. The arrow, sailed into the deer and at that moment I know that because of patience we will have some good eating tonight with a party to honer the good days of hunting."
