"Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn∆t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners."
