"A time that I was patient was when I took my first @CAPS1 test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a @NUM1 year old, imagine @NUM2 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the @CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes."
