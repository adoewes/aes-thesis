"Some people say that if somebody∆s trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but thats not always true. One day my brother was down loading new ringtones, which I thought was no big dig deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone.  The mosquito tone is a loud highpitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It∆s really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea. the one only a jerk could have. he decides he∆s going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curtle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my but it didn∆t really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of cource he said yes so I didn∆t have to the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesn∆t always work."
