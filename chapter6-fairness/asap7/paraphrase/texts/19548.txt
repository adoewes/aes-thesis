"On a fine @DATE1 day I was heading toward the @CAPS1 office. I wasn't pleased. I didn't want the son to get there. But it did. When we got inside, my mom went to the checkin lane I just sat down. When my mom got done she sat right next to me and we waited. And we waited and waited. We waited for about @NUM1 minutes until the @CAPS1 came and called us in. Right when we get into his office a nurse came in and checked my temperature, heat beat, ex. When she was done and left we waited and waited. We sat there for @NUM2 minutes before the @CAPS1 came in. when he was done we checked out and left and @CAPS2 don't have to go there again."
