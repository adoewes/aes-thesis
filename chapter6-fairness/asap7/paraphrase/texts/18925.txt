Once I was at an airport in @LOCATION1. We were coming home from @LOCATION2. After we got off the plane we had to go to customs. There were only two people working for @LOCATION3 citizens. The line was very long. After half an hour we were only half way through the line. There was a lot of waiting and a lot whining but we finally made it through. Of course they all thanked us for our patience and once the passport were stamped we were on our way to the next flight.
