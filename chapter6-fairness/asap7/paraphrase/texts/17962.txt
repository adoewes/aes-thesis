"Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting requires what you will think of as a lot of patience. When you are sitting in a tree blind you @MONTH1 experience one of the most boreing @NUM1 minutes of your life, which definetly requires a lot of patience. After you settle in and are being quite the wood come alive all around you. I have to admit, I don∆t have a lot of patience, but hunting requires a different kind of patience. Hunting is something that many might think as just sitting around doing nothing. But if you are patient enough and quite you are rewarded with whatever you are hunting. This is one thing that I definetly think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would think of it∆s an entertaining patience. That is why I think everyone should be more patient."
