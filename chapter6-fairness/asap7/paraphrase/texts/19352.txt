"I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my @NUM1 @CAPS2. I was so excited and jumpy. I was turning ten soit was a big deal for me. We all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running @CAPS4 it and ô@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.ö @CAPS4 it. The party started at @NUM2 am. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I keeped @CAPS4 asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldnÆt wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it the door bell rang and all my family came running in with presents and curds. I guess all that waiting really payed off. I also got some really cool presents."
