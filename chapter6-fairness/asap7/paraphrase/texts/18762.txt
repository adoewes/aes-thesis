Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. One day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didn∆t know about. After school I waited in the parking lot for close to @NUM1 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents weren∆t coming until a teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation the teacher let me call my parents. My dad had a appogized and went to get me after I explained then I could finally go home.
