"Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn∆t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn∆t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you."
