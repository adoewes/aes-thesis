"Patience? I am not a patient type of person. I am a @PERSON1 @CAPS1. He played in a @CAPS11 called @CAPS2 which l really wanted to @CAPS10. Which came out @DATE1. That l havent even seen yet until One day l was sitting in my porch where l asked my mom to @CAPS19 to @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS2 that @DATE2 when she said ""wlc"" l was really upset because l wanted to @CAPS10 it really really bad. I was being very patient at the time. I had called my @CAPS4's, @CAPS5's, sister's and brother's to fave me. @CAPS14 they said they were busy so l cried myself to sleep. The next @NUM1 days my mom and dad was talking about going to the movies and out to dinner. I walked in screaming and yelling ""@CAPS6 ARE @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 AND @CAPS10 A @CAPS11 AND @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS7 @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS9 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 OWN @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 I left out the room. The very next day my brother and his girlfriend went to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 it knowing l wanted to @CAPS9. They came home reasing me saying @CAPS6 good the @CAPS11 was. So that night l went down stairs to demand to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 ""@CAPS2"" saying "" I am being very patient with you all about taking me to @CAPS10 @CAPS2 @CAPS14 you all are pushing my buttons so l demand to @CAPS9 tomarrow"" @CAPS22 I waited @NUM2 second @CAPS22 she said that l could @CAPS9 this @DATE2. That was the very @NUM3 time that l was patient, and I'm proud of myself, I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 wait to @CAPS10 my @CAPS25 @PERSON1 @CAPS26"""
