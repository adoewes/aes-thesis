"One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didn∆t happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldn∆t stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didn∆t panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didn∆t take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldn∆t stop in time. When I hit my head it didn∆t hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didn∆t hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over."
