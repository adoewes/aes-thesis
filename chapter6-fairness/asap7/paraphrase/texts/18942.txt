"One time when I had a lot of paitenits is when I sprined my one ice skating. I was doing spins and trichs everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting @NUM1 times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to devnlop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didn∆t break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the resualts. It took a lot of paients for me to just wait, and, wait, and wait for those x-rays,"
