On @DATE1 me and my two friends were all laughing out but then I had rememberd that in @NUM1 min I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside and my friends were being so patient. They didn∆t leave me and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didnt keep them waiting. After I got done we went back up to the park and swang on the swing. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun one.
