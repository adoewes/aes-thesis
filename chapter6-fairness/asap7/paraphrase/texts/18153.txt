"Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. ô@CAPS1Æs that?ö I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, ôThat bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1Æs playing.ö ô@CAPS2Æt it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?ö I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system ô@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroomö, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. ô@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?ö my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold ôroö and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom."
