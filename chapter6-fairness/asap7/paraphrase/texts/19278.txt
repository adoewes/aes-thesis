"Go! @CAPS5 coach yelled. @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. @CAPS5 day was planned, first soccer then @CAPS5 friends birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain drop pound down on @CAPS5 head. Before I knew it I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started pouring. @CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. @CAPS2! The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally the refs come over and announced, ""the game has been delayed."" I signed and slouched down on a picnik table. I knew now I would @CAPS7 to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slamed down on the root and thunder cracked."" @CAPS1 would I make it to @CAPS5 party now?"" I through. @CAPS2! @CAPS2! @CAPS2! More thunder came. It had to go @NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already on minute @NUM2. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at @NUM3. We were now at minute @NUM4. We listened closely until we hear a @CAPS2! From far north frustrated I say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!"" @CAPS5 team began to count the minutes again. Finally after the longest @NUM1 minutes of @CAPS5 life there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! @CAPS5 team and I sprinted on to the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field with our white socks and jersys splattered. With mud. Every one of us were sopping wet. @CAPS5 mom gave me the ""@CAPS6 up"" look and I quickly ran to the car."" I will still make it to @CAPS5 party but, I will be just a few minutes late and I @CAPS7 to change in the car."" I said to @CAPS5 self. As I sprinted through the wet grass I heard @CAPS5 coach yell from behind me, ""@CAPS7 fun at your party @PERSON1, and @CAPS8 for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied ""@CAPS8 coach!"" That day I realized being patient is a good quality to @CAPS7. Many people appricite it when you are understaning and don't complian during difficult times."
