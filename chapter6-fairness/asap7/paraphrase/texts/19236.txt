"This a story about a time when I was patient. It was the @NUM1 @DATE1  we were on the plane about to go on a cruise, when we got to the ship I was so excited I was  thinking how much fun I was gonna have, think what my room would look like, and going to all these cool new places. So we got on the dock and there wa a line and I was patient an waited to get on, @CAPS1 there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. @CAPS1 there was another sticken line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said ôreadyö, I said ready for what another line he said ônoö to look at your ôroom and relax .ô I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing. But the bath room was a little small but it was great. I was so happy to final done with the lines no more! That is a time when I was patient."
