"One day I was at my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 house to celebrate my cousins @CAPS3. He was turning @NUM1 years old. So we played games played on the trampolenc. They we came inside to relax and watch some television. We played with there dog after a while. Then a lot of people came over. We went outside for a third time played. We had to come inside and @CAPS4 up for dinner. We all ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheese potatoes, squeen, beans. That was pretty good. Then they wanted us ??? project. It was a jon with a candle in it. We had to cover it in tisue paper and it uses lots of glue. I had to wait patiently I was the last one to domine. So I walled waited ??? then finally I got to do my project but I was ?? Only one there sitting at the table doing my project. It actually turned out pretty good after all. Being patient con get you very far in life. You have to be patient in a job, restraunt, and lots more. So remember just be patient and you'll be okay. Being patien will guide you through your hole life."
