"When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn∆t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn∆t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn∆t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn∆t patient in this game we wouldn∆t have won and I wouldn∆t have gotten the trophy to take home with me."
