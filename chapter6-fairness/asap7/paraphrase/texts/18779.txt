"Yo! IÆm the narratorà you know the dude that tells the story, well IÆm gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!"
