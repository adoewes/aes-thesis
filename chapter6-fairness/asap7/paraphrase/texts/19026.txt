"Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 saftey course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside wating. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck. That is my story, have a good night!"
