Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.
