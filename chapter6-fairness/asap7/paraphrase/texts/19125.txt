"A time when I was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting. It all began when we woke up at @NUM1 in the morning got dressed and left to go get in are deer blind. As soon as we got there we heard a lot of gun shots. From shot guns, rifles and even black powder. We waited all day until it was dark again then we packed up and we left. Me and my dad didn∆t see anything that whole day. That is a story about how I am patient."
