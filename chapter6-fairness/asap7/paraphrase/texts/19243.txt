"Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being toterant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, you∆re time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman ˚ @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didn∆t even see it, truth be told I∆m not even sure if it happen but you can∆t argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I∆m surprised her shot wasn∆t took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn∆t say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didn∆t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. I∆m just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didn∆t a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite! NobodyÊs perfect, you∆ll have to wait and see who will score the next point!"
