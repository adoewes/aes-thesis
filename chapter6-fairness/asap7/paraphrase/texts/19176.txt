"One time my volleyball team went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last people off our bus which means I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I talked to my friends as they waited too. Next I figured out, what I was going to eat, (@CAPS1 cheese, burger, @CAPS2 fry, and a large drink). ô@CAPS3 @CAPS4, @CAPS3 @CAPS4ö as I watched the clock my eyes got droppy ô@CAPS7, @NUM1ö the lady said. ô@CAPS8 @MONTH1 I take your order,ö she said. I told her what I wanted and she put it on her register and I began to wait. A couple minutes later I got my order. Finally after being patient I got my food. That was the time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1Æs???"
