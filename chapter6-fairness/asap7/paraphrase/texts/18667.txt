Luckily, @CAPS1 was the legendary many codscanth all that specif does is float slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two fish and gave them to his wife. Today all of fish are in the desert, which @CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @CAPS6 waits for something to jump out. Suddenly, @CAPS6 sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny. At was too far away to grab, though. @CAPS6 went home to his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @CAPS6 lunged for it and started chewing when something stabbed him. @CAPS1 started pulling fiercly when @CAPS6 heard a snap. When @CAPS6 tugged again @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 was finnaly free! @CAPS6 also realized the current felt pretty nice. @CAPS6 ate a couple of fish and slept. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breath and @CAPS6 was in a not @CAPS6 snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and died."
