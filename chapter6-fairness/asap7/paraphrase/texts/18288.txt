"It was @DATE1, @NUM1 my brothers birthday. He turned @NUM2 and he was makeing me mad because he kept asking my mom for stuff and he kept saying no she dont have it. Then he would ask my brother be like you know I got this money for my baby. So he would keep asking people and it was getting on my nerves because when somebody say they dont have it they dont have it. I didnt say nothing I was quiet because it was his birthday but I know how to be patience when it∆s something important or special. So I just was watching him and watching him and then I said here you can have my money it is your birthday so here you go. So I have gave him what he was angry and asking for and he got it I had patience because I didn∆t go off him because it was his birthday and it gave him what he wanted."
