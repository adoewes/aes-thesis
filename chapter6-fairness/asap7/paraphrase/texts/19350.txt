"One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were writing in line to put school supplies. We were number @NUM1 and they just called @NUM2. It was around @PERCENT1 out and we had to stand there. It was so long the new battery I had just put in my @NUM3 went dead. It took areand @NUM4 hours just to get inside. Then there were even more lines! We barly got our things that day, but because we were patient, we did."
