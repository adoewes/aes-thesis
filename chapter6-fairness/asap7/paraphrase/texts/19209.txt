A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vaction to @CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasn∆t one around but we found an ergent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I∆ll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vaction. That∆s a time where I was patient.
