A time that I was patience was last @DATE1 when I went to @CAPS1 point. I was about to get in line to ride the @CAPS2. I was at the begging at the line and then I saw a sign that @CAPS3 two hour wait from that point. But I wasn∆t that close to the sign so for me and my family and the other people that were in the same spot as us we must likely have to wait at lest two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day out and I was wearing black which probably wasn∆t the smartest @CAPS4. So I was waiting in line for about an hour only I just couldn∆t take standing in that hot wheather anymore but I really wanted to rive that rine so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patent then I was about @NUM1 minutes away from the ride and then the line just seemed like people left for me that was good cause then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a line that I was paitent.
