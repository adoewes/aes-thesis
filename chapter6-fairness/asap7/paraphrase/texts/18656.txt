"Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go throught it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldnÆt wait to get to @LOCATION1. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait @NUM1  hours until the plane left and weÆd be on our way to @LOCATION1. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers ôIÆm very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @MONTH1 not proceed until it clears up.ö @CAPS1!? ô@CAPS2 long will it take?ö asked my mom.ö About five hours, ôshe said. ItÆs a good thing we brought our @CAPS3 player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter @CAPS2 hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family."
