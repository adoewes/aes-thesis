One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.
