"Well, one day I saw a commercial on the awesome xbox @NUM1. The commercial said it would be out in @NUM2 weeks. @NUM2 weeks ÙI thought well that∆s going to take forever so I waited and waited and waited. I glamced at the clock. It said @NUM4, ÙI said,ˆ @CAPS1 only been @NUM5 minutes. So I started to play a game and I forgot about the xbox @NUM1. My dad said that we were going shopping to get my x-box. I∆m like, wow did it fly by. I guess if you don∆t think about it and be patient it will be over in no time."
