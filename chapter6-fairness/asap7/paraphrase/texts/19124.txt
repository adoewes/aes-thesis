I was patient when I was in school when my teacher left the room. The kids started going crazy and they were standing on tables. Throwing paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and paper in the @ORGANIZATION1. The kids were screaming and I was just sitting there waching as the teacher comes in and sees what is happening. I am just sitting there as I am amazd how stuiped they are acting. Then I am waching them get in trouble and get calls home. I am thinking good thing I was not part of it because I might get kicked from the cross country team. The kids are getting suspened for lunch. I hope that this never happens to me again because I was just a witness  thet can get the kids in even more troubley.
