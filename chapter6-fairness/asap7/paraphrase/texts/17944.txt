"One day alex was bothering be. Ao I decided to be patient. But he kept on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, so I decided to tell him to shut up. So again he didn∆t listen to me so I told @PERSON2, alex did not stop yet so I said nothing and was going to try to be patient with the @CAPS1. Talks a lot and @PERSON1. And eventually it did work and alex finally stoped. So I was happy. But he (alex) started again so I told him to stop on I would tell the teacher again. So he just shrugged his shoulders and kept right on doing all of the stupid noises. So I told the teachers and said alex you better stop this instinse. So alex you better stoped and began resibling with his pencil all over his peace of paper."
