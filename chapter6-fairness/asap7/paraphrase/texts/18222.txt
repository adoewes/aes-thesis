"I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 for this @DATE1. The line must have at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! ô@CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. IÆm sorry. Thanks for your cooperationö click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! ô@CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! ItÆs time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9!ö That was my story of being patient."
