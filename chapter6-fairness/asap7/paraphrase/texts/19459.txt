"Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don∆t. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It∆s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!"
