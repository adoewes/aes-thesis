"Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is hard and for some its easy. For me, I'm ok at patience. Like I'm patiencet for this game I pre-ordered. It comes out @DATE1. When I'm not patiencet is when I want I get on the computer. I Was also patiencet for getting my second class rank, well thats all I have to say about patience."
