"The time I was patient was when @CAPS4 went to @LOCATION1 ""mom!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS1's go I want to leave I'm packed and ready to go."" @CAPS2 mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beutiful @DATE1 in @LOCATION2 and it was also @CAPS2 step dad's birthday. ""@CAPS3 you need to be patient okay, @CAPS4 have a long drive, do you have everything you need."" @CAPS5 got me there. I had to get, coloring materials, the portable @CAPS6 player, ectà. I had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 needed until @CAPS2 stomach growled it sounded like a bear protecting it's cubs, fierce, and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in @CAPS2 head, food thats what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips. Saltandvinager, sour crean and onion (caross) and jolepenyo ceddar(yum). Now I have everything I thought, ""of @CAPS4 go."" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom and again I rushed out the door ""got the address,"" asked @CAPS2 father."" @CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it."" @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started to go @CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 was sleeping lik arock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks shore. after @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitment was rushing so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but I was marked impossible. Finally @CAPS2 step father yelled ""wake up!!"" I was so tierd when I woke up, "" are @CAPS4 there yet, first thing that came out of @CAPS2 mouth ""yeah"" and, of course, the first things I did was jump up and out of the care! ""@CAPS12!"" @CAPS2 mother shouted. I paused as if I was a charactor in a video game and the player press pause."" @CAPS13 take in some off the bags."" ""@CAPS14"" I said with a scowse on @CAPS2 face. ""@CAPS15 youhave to be patient"" as I took in the bag there it was to condo of @CAPS2 dreams and the first thing I did was sleep."
