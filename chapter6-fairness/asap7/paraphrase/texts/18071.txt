"I have used patience many times. I use my patience when @ORGANIZATION1 on the bus, at home and at school. The first time when used patiencewas when I was fishing. I was to at the time I had my tweety @CAPS1 fishing in one hand and a bag of salt and viniger in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish, I met my friend bubbles a norweigian goose he was also out maybe a week old. When I met him I fed him some of my bait and I guessed he liked warms so I gave him all my bait put down pole. And as soon as I grabed my chipsà I had a bite! I turned out to be a very small sun fish. But still to this day I see bubble once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year he had some side kicks two ducks I named them @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. There are very friendly and love skittles. @CAPS2 is kind of shy around other ducks and @PERSON1 is very content just sitting next to me or a bench. And bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm @DATE1 grass. And this story is true. The @CAPS3."
