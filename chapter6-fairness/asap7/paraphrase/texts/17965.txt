"In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you don∆t be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didn∆t get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience. Thy choice of patience is you have to be patience and wait your turn to go.  The whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life."
