"This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. This happens every year IÆm pretty sure every one knows about it. It is call birthday. Every year I have to wait for @NUM1 days for my birthday to come. It takes a while, but I know I have to be patient. Being patient is hard work but usually pays off. Another way that  I have to be patient is waiting for the @CAPS1 tests to get over . But I always remember it has to end sometime. So I have to sit there do the work and be patient."
