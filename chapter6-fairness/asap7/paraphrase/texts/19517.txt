"Patience is a very diffult thing @CAPS1 some people. One time I was at a huge party. But none of my friends or cousins were there. I was board the whole time. I asked my mom if we can go home she said ""no"". Then I sat down I waited and waited @CAPS1 a really long time. Then finally we went home. The next day my mom sent me over to my cousins house @CAPS1 a sleep over. This was because I was being patient at the party. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You recieve good when you be patient."
