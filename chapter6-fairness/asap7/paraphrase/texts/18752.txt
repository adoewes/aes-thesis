This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a wii and no one would buy me one. So I saved up my money for so long. Then I had to wait what felt like weeks was @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days. That just made it feel longer. So I desided to tell my self I didn∆t want it so I wasn∆t anxious to get it. That kind of worked. But when I got it to tell you the truth it isn∆t as fun as I thought it would be.
