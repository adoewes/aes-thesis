"On our way to @CAPS1 point ! IÆm screaming in my head .ItÆs so crazy ! were just derost from on lake erie . I see it ! It was right there within walking distance .Oh my gosh the parking lot we pull up in all the way to the stamp station & we get our stamps & we walk up to the medal bars we stop & the security say ô noö .We found out it only opens at ten so we waited & waited & waited & more & more & more people came ,& soon it got really crowded & more people came & me & my cousins @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 all went to go play phase title and we had wait in line for that to .Finally @NUM1 time to get into the park we all crowded up to the fince & ram out selfs in there we went and got in line  for the rapter for @NUM2 min .Man what a line but hey it was so worth it .And yes patience helps ôa lot ô"
