I was patient this one time while waiting to get on the computers and I told my mom to wake me if she gets oyr the computer and after an hour I fell asleep and I woke up after a little while and my brother was on for three hours reading manag we already have and after three minutes my dad kicked me off to check his email and he said he would be off soon yet he spent the rest of the day a  hit more of the next day watching indearath  star(for six hours even though he spends eight hours on a connecting at work so that adds @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the internet everyday of the year.
