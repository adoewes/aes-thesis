She and my mom were going to soon and wouldnÆ@CAPS1 be back till nine p.m so she needed me to come over. So my mom move me over there and dropped me off at seven p.m went through after a brief entry on what to do if there is an emergency. When they left, me and the kids wrestled and watched @CAPS1.v.
