"Over the @DATE1 my dad, my brother and I went to @CAPS1 point. It was really hot but we didn∆t care we really wanted to ride the millennium force. We found the ride but we first looked at the line it was huge. It shaked almost around the whole ride twice, so we got to the end of the line and sat in the blazing hot sun for a half an hour till we found our cover selves under a tent they put up so it was some what cool in line. So we waited a longer and longer till my brother started to flip out yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, ÙI can∆t wait here any longerˆ @CAPS2 he went under the ?? and ?? off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour when finnaly, it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and my brother were not here so l decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride. When l got on they still weren∆t there, well the ride took off and they weren∆t the best ride ever with me."
