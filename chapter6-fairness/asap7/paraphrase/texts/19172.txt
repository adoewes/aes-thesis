Having a melt @CAPS1! I have expereanced this @CAPS2 scene when I was in the @NUM1 grade at cross creeds christm school. It was the @DATE1 and we lived just around the corner. @CAPS3 @NUM2 minutes my patients where a little almost at the fact that my mother wasn∆t there get and @CAPS3 @NUM3 minutes later I had a temper  tantrism and cryed and my patients was like a ballot that poped and lowered slowly as I grew angrier and. Angryer at the fast my mom wasn∆t there yet. This mast ake will @CAPS4 happen again to me. I made the rong chose to get mad over something redic  usasly  dumb. Learn from my words I as @CAPS4 give up keep trying.
