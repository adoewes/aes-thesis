There I was on a cold @DATE1 @TIME1. Still almost pitch black. I was hunting in my blind with my dad so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost @NUM1 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about @NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner.
