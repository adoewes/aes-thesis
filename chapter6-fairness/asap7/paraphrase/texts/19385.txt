"One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I∆m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, it∆s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient"
