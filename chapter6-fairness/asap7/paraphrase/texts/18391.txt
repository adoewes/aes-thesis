"When I was in fifth grade I wasn't doing so well in math so my @CAPS1 agreed on helping study for my upcoming test. So on @DATE1 I got up really early but my mom was running really late getting home from work, and she was the one driving me there. So my @CAPS1 was being really understanding and patient. So my mom got home drove me and we ended up a hour and a half late but my @CAPS1 was still very patient. So we started to help me and I was completely lost I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she still tried and was very understanding. I got almost every question wrong that she asked me and she still try to her best ability to help me understand it. She had to helping me for about @NUM1 hours but she followed through and really helped me and I actually got a A on that quiz all because of her help and patience with me. I know it must have been hard to work with me for that long without losing her patience with me and I really respect that and I am very grateful to know someone like that."
