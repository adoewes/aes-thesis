As I walked down the lane looking for the perfect gift I saw the day before. I find out it was sold out. Today was my mom∆s birthday and I find the gift. The perfect gift a precious moment figurine. I asked the manager  if fact had any in the back sadly they didn∆t. He said ÙThe new shipment should be arriving at fiveˆ. I didn∆t think I could wait another three hours. My dad drove me home. I was pacing back and forth thinking it would occupies sadly it didn∆t. Finally I realized I needed to relax and be patient before. I know if the time was five and my dad and I went back at the store in no time and there was the perfect gift right there in front of me. I picked it up and give it to the clerk to scan. I hand her the money and head strait home. When mom get home I hand mom the gift and realize patient come in handy when it comes to waiting.
