"I remeber, just a few days ago, my mother had to get her tooth checked out and guess what I did, I read a book! Even though it took forever, I was done with my @NUM1 minute homework. When my mom came back we got up to leave and my feet were name. So far my patience we got ice cream. So you could get rewarded if your just patient."
