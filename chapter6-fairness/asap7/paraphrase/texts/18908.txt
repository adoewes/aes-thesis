Once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and thatÆs the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasnÆt going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said ôno w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.ö @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2.
