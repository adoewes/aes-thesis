"I was patient once when my dad had said he was going to give me a letter every @DATE1 because he was to far away for me to visite he lives all the way in @LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because I∆m not really the patient tipe.I guess being patient is not all that hard. For me to be patient I have to being doing something so I get myself to rest by writing stars and drawing, reading, going to any around mother house to help with our animals. And when he finally comes I didn∆t even get it. Milk @DATE2 so I had to wait even longer within I guess on sit that was to do you just have to have mind on the thing you have to be patient about it."
