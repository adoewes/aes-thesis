"Every day at launch I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especialy when your waiting in line, then you really have to be patient. But sometimes your lucky and you can go to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch you can go out ride and play. But @CAPS1 you must finish your food and throw it away and wait patienty. And thats a time when I was patient."
