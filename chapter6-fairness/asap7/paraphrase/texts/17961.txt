We wated for like a half and hour to get other food. We wated patiently and we got other food and we sat down at a table and that was the last table. Then a family of for was loocking for a seat and @CAPS1 we got up and gave them our table. Then we went to the movies and we waited in line and @PERSON1 was being impatient @CAPS1 we had him save our spot. Then I took @PERSON1 across the walk way and got @PERSON1 a show thick. Now @PERSON1 was upto pay @CAPS1 we walked back to the movie theater and we bought @NUM1 bags of  popcorn, and then we paenently wated in line to get our seats.
