"A time that I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. It was after my birthday and I had wanted pink @ORGANIZATION1 shoes. My dad in @LOCATION1 said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandmas house and then have my grandma send them to me and that I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes and in one week. They were not at my house. I ididnt want to buy my dad and call him every day about them so I just patiently waited. After @NUM2 more week I began to worry and get mad so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour and my shoes still hadn∆t come. At this point I just decided they would just come when they came and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day and I was estatic. I thanked my dad and I wore my shoes the next day knowing my patience payed off."
