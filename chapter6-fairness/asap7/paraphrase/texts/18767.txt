"Patient day. I remember the time when I was patient for a toy car. Four @CAPS1 I hate to waent for @NUM1 whole days. Each day it felt like I was in jail. So I was getting mad each day slaping people in the face it was so funny so my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was mad at me. then my mom put me on punishment. Then couple days later I was dooing good in school. So my mom was so proud of me. Then she bout me a lot of stuff. Later that chirstmas day we had turkey ranch dressing. Then I open my presents. I got the toy car, @NUM2, monster truck cars shoes and @ORGANIZATION1Æs blue, red, @CAPS4 any collars you can think of. So that is why I was patient that toy I was so happy and my @CAPS5 stop by and gave me @NUM3 dallers. Then he took me ice @CAPS6 shade to were these skinny tites. But it all worked out for me at the end. I got every thing I wanted and I want a load touch with the @NUM3 @CAPS7. It felt like I was rich for chirstmas day."
