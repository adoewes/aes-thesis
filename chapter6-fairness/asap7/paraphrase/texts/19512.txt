"My friend @PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch line, he waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line. He was behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. @PERSON1 was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complian. The line was longer because there was a presentation and then it was lunch, the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders didn't have lunch yet so that was why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a good @CAPS2 waiting. When many students were filling up the tables I saved @PERSON1 a seat next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the @CAPS1 and milk cooler and grab a orange @CAPS1. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When when he came and sat down next to me I told him he did a good @CAPS2 be patient and waiting to get his lunch. I was almost done with my macovoni and cheese when @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS3 for safeing a seat for me."" When we both finished we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafaterra. In the gym other kids were playing a small basketball game. @PERSON1 grab a basketball. I waited until the @NUM2 grated were done, I was patient, the teacher then told the younger students to go back to class, when I got the ball I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to play around the world. It was one at @PERSON1's and I favorite game we played."
