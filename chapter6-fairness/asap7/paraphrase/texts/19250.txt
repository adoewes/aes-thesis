"One time I was patient was when I had to get some @CAPS1 done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @CAPS1. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited, I decided to watch an episode of spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasn∆t done! So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1... and so on I got to @NUM2 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasn∆t. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2 got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my @CAPS1. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long."
