"At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that∆s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn∆t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient."
