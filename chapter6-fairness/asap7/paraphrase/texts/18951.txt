"One day I woke up and looked outside it was snowy +cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasn∆t feeling well so my mother checked my tempture and said I had a??? .I also had a runny nose so she said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work @DATE1 and she said she would stay from work to stay home with me. So she made my hot chocolate and breakfast every time I need something she just got up and got it for me. Every time I needed something like a drink, food or even another blanket she got up and got it for me. She was patient because every single time I asked for something she got it without complaining she just did what I asked her to do. She even went up town to get me my medication. That is why my mother is the best and patient."
