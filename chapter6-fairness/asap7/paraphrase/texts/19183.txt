"I∆m writing a story about patience. Patience in can say like I∆m waiting for you to get done with whatever your doing. Something like the o, say @CAPS1 been waiting for the kids to be quite. And they can∆t so even though she∆s getting mad, she still being patient with us instead of saying get out my class giving us chance after chance. Because she want us to be good and stay in class."
