"This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I haven∆t had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has some money, and I need something new she gets it. I was waiting patiently for my mom. I had confidence that my mom would by me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes."
