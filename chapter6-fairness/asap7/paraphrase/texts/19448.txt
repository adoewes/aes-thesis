"I remember when me, my brother, my dad and my mom were at ceder point. I wanted to go on so many rides but they all had big lines. So we waited for the rapter that took one hour just to get on the ride but when we got on it felt like it was even longer then the wait in line it felt like @NUM1 hours because of how ??? it was. We walked and saw the ??? force it had a ??? ??? on it so we waited in line was much longer than the rapter it was like 3-@NUM1 hours. But when we got to the hop of the stairs we were up it was so much fun because we waited so long and my brother stopped complen because he was so ??? in me. the ride was fun but when we were done we had to leave ??? was like mom. We only wait on the rides but it was fun and ??? That was a time when I was patient."
