"I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things .If you be patient things will actually come faster than you think for example if you want something and you have to wait in line instead of running off and finding  something else at and wait it will always help. Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient what even  your  doing  even if your waiting for a turn just wait it is not a big deal stop rushing things, just be very patient."
