"One day in the @CAPS1, I had to sit for two hours cause I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there a lot of people, we stay there a very long time, cause there were only @NUM1 docters and this lady took so long. So it was my turn to go in but I was scar that if hurts but then he was doing and it didn∆t hurt for nothing. And then I went home."
