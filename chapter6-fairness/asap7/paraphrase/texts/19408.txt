"There was a boy that wanted to go to gym so when he got there he had to chance. But the was a sertant basketball he wanted. As he was getting dressed other boys got out there first and took the ball. Later when he got out he saw they had it. So when he got over he was mad and took it from them. After the insadent he came and gave it to them and sayed ôI can waitö. So when the were done he got it he was so happy and proud, that he finally got the basketball. When he got home he told @CAPS1 mom and she said that she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked,öwhat is that?ö @CAPS1 mom said ôit is a thing when you understand and tolerant. The boy was very happy because he always used to take things and now he can wait to use something to be happy. That boy now lives happy with @CAPS1 mom in high school patiently moving along the end."
