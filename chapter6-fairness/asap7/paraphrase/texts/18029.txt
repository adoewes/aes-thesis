"On @DATE1 it was my birthday I was just turning @NUM1. I was so happy!!! Well while I was being happy and my big sisters were getting thing together for my party my mom was at work. We had everything at the party thing such as juice, pop, food, candy, chips, icecream, but no cake. My mom was suppose to pick it up when she got of work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After we opened all my gifts, it was time for cake and icecream. We had the icecream but no cake, but I didn∆t cry and scream like a baby, my sister did but she was still @NUM2 and I was @NUM1 and I had to act as a @NUM1 year old. My mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she get my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I was happy I waited like a big kid, but I was even more happier I was @NUM1!"
