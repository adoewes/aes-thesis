"As I waited at the airport, I gazed at all walking by I pondered these thoughts in my head: Ùwhen will @CAPS2 be here?ˆ @CAPS1 long have I been waiting and what time is it, wasn∆t his flight supposed to be here @NUM1 minutes ago? Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice Ê@CAPS2 will be here soon, honey dont worry.∆ I dont understand @CAPS1 my mother told a @NUM2 year old not to worry it was in our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself Êwhat good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.∆ @CAPS3 these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me, I ran to him and gave him a hug. ÊI almost lost my patient∆ @CAPS4 glad I stayed patient because if I wasn∆t it would∆ve ruined my fathers trip. Patience is a good thing to have, you can gain or lose things from it. In this case I think I gained something."
