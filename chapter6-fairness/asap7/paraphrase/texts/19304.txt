"This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me."
