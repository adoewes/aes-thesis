"During the @DATE1 between forth and fifth grade, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1! @CAPS4 of the rides had lines, but none of them had line as long and the @CAPS2  @CAPS3. The line was huge! As my brothers, their best friend and I approached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS5 thought @CAPS5 would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but @CAPS5 didnÆt see the point. When @CAPS5 got about half way, one of the employees shouted, ô@NUM1 more minutes!ö and @CAPS5 @CAPS4 became more excited. Eventually, @CAPS5 made to the front of the line! @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had to do was wait for the current trial was over! But then, the speaker came on, ô@CAPS4 rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and @CAPS5 must because of safety issues.ö @CAPS5 had @CAPS4 considered leaving, but had a feeling @CAPS5 shouldnÆt. @CAPS5 talked with some other kids @CAPS5 met in line. @CAPS5 played games like rocks, paper, scissors while @CAPS5 waited under the pavillion above the line. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thankyou from my dad  for keeping us in line."
