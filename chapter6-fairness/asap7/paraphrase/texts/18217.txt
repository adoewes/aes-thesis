"I am going to tell you about a time I was impatient. I had been working everyday in the @DATE1. I was trying to do the best I could to make make money. I was saving up to by a three hundred dollar bow, a firty dollar target, forty dollar broadbands, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it. Finally I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff. I practiced all day long. Soon I became more accurate. I was ready to go hunting. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards. I haven∆t had anything close enough to shoot since then."
