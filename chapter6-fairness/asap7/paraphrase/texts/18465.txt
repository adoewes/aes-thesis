"One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for six grade. I didnt want to go but I had to go I didnt have a choice so I get in the car and we drive to the doctors office. Finally we arrived. My mom had to sign in and we sat down. Even though I was waiting for three hours I didnt complain about it. The doctors comes out and I got scared but happy that finnaly its my turn. Then he called a different name so whe and my awesome mother kept on waiting in the waiting room, then my beloved mother tells @CAPS6 wow @CAPS1 your not complaining now. I know manages thatÆs because @CAPS2 becoming more mature and I have a lot of patience. Thank @CAPS3 the doctor calls my name ô@CAPS1 @CAPS5.ö @CAPS6 and my mom go in the room.
