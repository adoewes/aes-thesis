"My mum is someone who is patient. One time when I was little, I got gum stuck in my hair. I was crying a lot and moving around as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself. When she couldn∆t get it out and said that she would have to at in out, I had screamed. Tet, with patience, she was some how able to cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice even though I wouldn∆t sit still. I think my mom is the most patient person that I know, because whenever something happen, she is patient about it."
