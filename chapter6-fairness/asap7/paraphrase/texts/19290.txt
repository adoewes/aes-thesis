"ô@CAPS1 onö. Said my little brother. @CAPS2 line is tacking forever. ô@CAPS2 is the last time we are coming on @CAPS2 rideö. The ride that we were on was space mountain at @ORGANIZATION1 land in @LOCATION1. As we got into line at the ride there was a sighn I have and @NUM1 min wate from @CAPS2 point. It was hot and it felt like I was walking smil. The line would not go any faster. My older brother was happy for some reason. No one could understand we were standing in line in @NUM2 weather. I was being as patience as I could be I just stood in line wish, hoping to pay self we could get on the oder. The first hour went by and another sighn came up @NUM3 hour from @CAPS2 point. We all got mad. The walk way sounded silent. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as a drop or someoneÆs?? hit the ground. Everyone being patient. Finally we wated @NUM4 hours to go on just @NUM3 ride. That was the first time I was that patient."
