"It takes a lot of patients especially when you are travelling for @NUM1 hours strait. When I was @NUM2 we went to @LOCATION3 for a half a year. Me my mom and my dad left at @NUM3 am for the airport. We waited there for a long time. When we finally got on the plane we took the hour long flight to @LOCATION4. Ten a @NUM4 hour flight to los @LOCATION1. We waited in those airports for a long time. Then came the @NUM5 hour flights to @LOCATION2. That was the longest flight IÆve ever been on. The plane was a huge double deck @NUM6 jet. Then we took the @NUM7 hour flight to hawk bay. It was a really long trip. It took a ton of patients. Well we went there because my dad was making a golf coarse. That takes a lot of patients too but, its a lot more fun. That was the most patient IÆve ever had to be."
