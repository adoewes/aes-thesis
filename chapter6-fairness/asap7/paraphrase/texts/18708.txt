"A time when had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @LOCATION2. From my house to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 it∆s about @NUM1 hrs away. So I had to sit in a car for @NUM1 hours. The only things to do were listen to your ipod and sleep. Which I didn∆t do either of those things. As you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour had passed it would have felt like @NUM4 if you weren∆t doing anything. By that time I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping. I knew I couldn∆t do that though. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people but no one answered. I tried looking out the window but that made me sleepy. Getting there took too long. Finally @NUM1 hours passed and we made it to @LOCATION2. This was a time when I had patience"
