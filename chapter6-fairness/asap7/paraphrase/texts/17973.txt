"Last @DATE1 I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And we drove for hours! O my go she butt hort! We got there and there were no packing spots, so we went to the back back lot! but then I was excited we were walking towards the park I was the wicked twister and surprised my @CAPS3 asked me to pick the first ride I said the wicked twister so we got in and I looked at the line for the wicked twister and guess what it took @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride I was so patient that day and then we cut the corner and there was like @NUM2 more people! So that day I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole @NUM3 pound burgers fries and a shake! So theres my story about my patience!"
