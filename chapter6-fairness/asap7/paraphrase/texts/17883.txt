But this silck worm had a problem he was still to skiny to change he had to be nice & fat like a fat pratle stick cut in half. He crold going bush to bush eating any green leave he could find. But here∆s where a nether problem kicked in to please. It was becoming winter cut side, so every leave he found was brown & nasty. In the grass was changing to. But he wanted to change in to a moath so bad that he had chose but to eat the die leave & grass. In he was very patient about it to.
