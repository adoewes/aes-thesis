"I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life."
