"I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient  so my mom would think itÆs time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel. But she still didnÆt say it was the time to get a phone the next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but better. I still didnÆt get it I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said ô@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get somethingö I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said ôwait @CAPS2ö me still wondering   watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I dint do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house. @DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said ô@CAPS2 you can have your phone now and I hugged her tight and run out the door very eagerly to try it out."
