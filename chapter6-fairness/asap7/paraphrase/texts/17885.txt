"I was patient on the trip to @LOCATION1 it took two days to get down there I got hungery and had to go to the bathroom when ever I was hungery I had to what until next stop when we got gas so when it was on full I had to be patient with out complaining. So, I had to be patient until the gas tank was empty that∆s when we got gas and I could eat something or I had to be patient until there was a @CAPS1 on the right hand or a test area because the have a vending machine there and bathrooms there too. On the right hand side because we can get off on get back on the high way. That∆s when I had to be patient."
