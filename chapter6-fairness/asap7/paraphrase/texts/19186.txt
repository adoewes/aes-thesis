"There is time in everyones life were they have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my brother learn how to tye his shoes. I know this sounds like an easy task but it really isn∆t. Time after time again my brother attempted to tye his shoes but could never do it. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I will teach him. When we got started I thought this would be over in about five minutes but no! He could not make the bunny ears. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the knot as hard as he could and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps but no, he was determined to tye his shoes. After about an hour of tying he finally got it! He didnt tye them perfectly but it was good enough to keep them tyed I said good job and started to walk to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot. So of course I walk over and tell him just cross the two bunny ears and loop around but he didnt get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didn∆t get it. We hit the half hour ??? for the double ??? and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When it came back my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudley."
