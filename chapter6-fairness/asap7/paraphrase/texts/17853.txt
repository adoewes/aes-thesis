I recall once a famous madican named @PERSON1 was prefering a stunt that took enourmous amounts of pateints and courage it was named ô@CAPS1 In Timeö. The madichian had to stay in a block of ice for @NUM1 dayÆs or @NUM2 hours! The great madichian had only a sweater. He had the consiled  ice open to public as the magnificent madichian said ôI could bearly hear anythingö. He waited hours on and like falling down on abyiss or bottomless pit. Until the final seconds ended. The madichian as finally free. And alive
