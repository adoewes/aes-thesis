A time I was patient was when my mom was take me to my friends house to play foot ball. It is a long story but I will tell you anyways. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 called me over to come play football. So I asked my mom for a ride she said ôyesö. So when we were driving my ???? she had to get after things from the grocery store. She took in hule hour in there. The she had to go some were else she took @NUM1 hours in there.then my called and said ôare you coming or whatÆ. Then I said yes. I was so kept my cool and waited. Then I finally got there. It not much of a story. That was the time I was patient.
