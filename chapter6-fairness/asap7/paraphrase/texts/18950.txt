"I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldn∆t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. Ù@CAPS1∆s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,ˆ she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn∆t that patient and I learned I∆m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn∆t. That∆s  the time of when I know  someone was patient."
