"Being patient means that your understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friend∆s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didn∆t have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something big∆s tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn∆t break. Finilly I held the fish high over my head in a triumghant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years."
