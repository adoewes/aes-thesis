"This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plain in an airport. We were on ar way to @LOCATION1 and we had to take two plains to get there. When we got off the plain to the second airport we went to go see what time our second flights comes in. when we found out the time for the second flight we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. my mom told me I had to be patient but I am not good at being patient. To get things off my mind we decided to eat. When I was done eating. I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it was annoying me. So I started to play my ds. Before I knew it we only had one hour left so playing my ds distracted me. I got impatient real fast, so that∆s when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden our plain arrives I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learnt to be patient."
