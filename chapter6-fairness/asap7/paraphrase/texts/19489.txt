I was patient when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors me and my mom wait patient for a long time. It felt like years but it was alone for @NUM1 hour then when the doctor called us back to the room wait for a long period of time and a nother half-hour we waited. I asked my mom ôwhy did it take foreverö my mom said ôbecause their other people befor us.ö ôohö I said ok then.
