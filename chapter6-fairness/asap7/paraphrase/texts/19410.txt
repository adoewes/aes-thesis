"One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me so she sat with me where ever I went. Mind you there were girls around so I got embarrased and asked mom why are you following me and she replyed cause I don∆t want you running everywhere. That when I told her mom I older now, I∆m not sorle years old, I∆m muture now. She said @CAPS1 go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying Ùyour mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said Ùwas you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story."
