"A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team, it was fifteen days befor compition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom cutine in our second formation wasnt in a diagnal line we were supposed to be and wasnt getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1(one of our coaches daughters) was yelling at the side IÆm on for not getting to the kickline in time even though shes the on pushing us father down so we cant get there then she started yelling at @PERSON1 saying it was all her falt so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, ô@LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything you arnt perfect at everything ether, and your  the ones pushing us over so we cant get to the kickline in time.ö @LOCATION1 didnt know what to say but she said ô@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isnt true.ö even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline she didnÆt move closer to the center she moved farther and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends, they still are friends, just not best friends."
