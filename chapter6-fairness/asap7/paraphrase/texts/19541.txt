"A time when I was patient was when @DATE1 we drove to @LOCATION1. It was a long ride. It was long because he had a nagshion that went the long way to six flag and to our hotel. I try not to complan and be patient because the ride was a daylong so that means sitting for almost a day! We were lost in @LOCATION1 for almost a hour going up and down looking for our cusion that were coming too. I had to search but there was no space to. I wanted to go outside and run, jump but I hade to be patient. It was @NUM1 in the morning and I was tird. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking for ever! At the hotel I was unpacking my stuff and notice I was patient for almost a day which I though I would never be able to do in a car. That was the time I was being patient."
