"Im not a very patient person so im going to be wrighting about what patience @CAPS6. Patience @CAPS6 when you donÆt complain when your board or waiting for somthing. For example (for your convenance I @CAPS1 be wrighting a story about patience, please  take to note that this story @CAPS6 completely untrue) @CAPS1 was walking home and saw an elderly woman, she was having trouble with her grocerys. @CAPS1 wanted to help her but all he was thinking about was his cousin @CAPS2 that @CAPS4 be arriving at his house any moment now. @CAPS1 walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied ôif you could I live over @CAPS3ö she pointed to a large tan house. @CAPS1 carried her things to the door. ô@CAPS3 you go,ö he said. ô@CAPS4 you mind helping me put them awayö the woman asked. @CAPS1 thought about how his mother never wanted him to go into a strangers house, but @CAPS1 sort of knew her, so he said that he @CAPS4 help the woman smile. @CAPS1 then picked up the bags and said, ô@CAPS6 your home unlockedö ô@CAPS7 its notö she replied, where are your keysö @CAPS1 asked, ôI beleve there lost somwere in the lawn. @CAPS1 searched for about a half hour, then he found them under a bush. He brought the keys to her and said ô@CAPS3 you go,ö she opened the door and he helped her with her grocres. When they were all put away @CAPS1 said ô@CAPS11 I ought to be going.ö ô@CAPS11 not without somway I can repay youö said the woman ô@CAPS13 go find my purse.ö @CAPS1 waited and waited, it had to have been a hour. The woman came out of the kitchin with some change. ô@CAPS15 its only change, I couldnÆt find my walletö she said and gave him the change. @CAPS1 left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman. @CAPS1 told his mom about his good deed and his cousin @CAPS2 got to stay longer. This was my example of patience, if this ever happens to you make sure your patient and know the person."
