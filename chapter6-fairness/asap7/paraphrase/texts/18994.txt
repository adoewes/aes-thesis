"When I was patient I ask my mom to buy me a bike and I had to wait and wait for like two weeks for a bike on my birthday I wanted a fish, and I ask my mom to buy me a fish she didn∆t say anything so I keep asking and asking and asking so I stoped asking for three days then she got me a fish then it died. Four weeks later then I ask for a turtle and she said yea she will then I waited and waited tell she got me one then I was happy that∆s when I was patient."
