"I had a friend well she is @CAPS4 best friend and we know each other from @NUM1 grade then in @NUM2 grade she said she said she has to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until this one day came she called and @NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over are house. One of @CAPS4 mom friend calls me and I told  @CAPS1 (@CAPS4 best  friend) hold on someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on @CAPS4 bed while she  was still o the phone. I went to the living room and @CAPS4 moms friend said can you get me a glass of water and @CAPS4 moms five other friends said the some thing. I went and got them water. After that @CAPS4 mom said go take out the trash so I went and put on @CAPS4 scarf and took at the trash out the like @NUM4 mins I had her waiting. When I took out the trash @CAPS4 best friend was and she said @CAPS3 can you stay outside with me and play for a little bit and I forget all about @CAPS4 friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @NUM5 min. then said I got to go back inside. I ment in and sat on the sof and @CAPS4 moms friends that were over are house were talking and I sat with than talking laughing, playing, and watching t.v.  After two hours and a half while I am watching t.v. I tell myself what am I forgetting. I knew I forget something, but I didn∆t know what so I get up and I walk around the whole telling myself what  did I forget when I get to the room I was talking to @CAPS1 in I seen the phone on the bed and I picked up and said @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 I forgot about her. I said hello just to see if she was still there even if I had a feeling she didn∆t which did. She told me you kept me waiting for the longest time ever. I told her wow your so patient I would never wait that long. She come on you∆re @CAPS4 best friend. I would wait forever for you so we continued talking."
