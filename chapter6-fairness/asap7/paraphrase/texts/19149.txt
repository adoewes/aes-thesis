"Usually I have very little patience (and yes I do know that patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospitle room with any dad to spend time with my mom, @CAPS1 was very boring, but somehow I managed to go the whole day (up to where my dad finally let me watch @CAPS2.V. in the room) without being baerd to tears."
