"There goes another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, l though that l should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""@CAPS6 is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience ."" l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you @MONTH1 get rewarded!"
