"IÆve been patent plenty of times but when I ordered a new game console that is when I had to be patient. My dad and I were getting a game console that would be at our porch in two weeks. For me it felt like a life time, but I had to keep patient. Not for those fourteen days did I complain, niether did my dad. when it came, it was definitely worth the wait. That is a time when it was necessary to have patience and to not complain."
