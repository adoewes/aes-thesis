"A time I had to be patient was when we went to @LOCATION2. It was a @NUM1 hour flight with a two hour layover in @LOCATION1. It was really hard for me to be patient because I really wanted to go to @LOCATION2. In the layover to pass time I listend to my ipod and used my macbook pro to get on face book. It really helped me be patient because it took my mind of @LOCATION2 and we were in @LOCATION2 in know time, and when we arrived my patient∆s paid of because I got to swim on beaches and party I @LOCATION2 for @DATE1 break @DATE2 that is my story about a time I was patient."
