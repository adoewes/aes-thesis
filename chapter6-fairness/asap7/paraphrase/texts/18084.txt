"One day my family and me where going to @PERSON1 to see jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After me and my brother got home from school we left to go to @LOCATION2 as we where travelling  we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there . Then we seen a sign  that says ôyou are how leaving @LOCATION3ö and another sign that said you are how entering @LOCATION1 and thatÆs when  it happened the traffic jam. We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m how smart was that not very but the worst part was the waiting I t  lasted for hours just sitting there but we found ways to away ourselves. Like watch the sea @PERSON2Æs ,waves, and  look at the buildings there. ThatÆs my example of patience."
