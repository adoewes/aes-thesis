"When I have patient is when I go out to eat. So no one can speat in, my food. Like one time I went out to eat with my family. And we all was dress alike for my birthday. So I ask my daddyto tell them that my birthday is to day. And I wanted a piece of cake now. So he want to tell what I said and they ??? give us a minute. So I waited and waited. And finly said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place brun down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finly bring my cake. And they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that in tell I found out they speat in my food and ate itto. I had found out because before I lifte I heard some people talking about how they speat in my food. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea. Then I said o I don`t care cause I didnt eat the fries. They said why I because I the fries is neasty. And I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don`t  do that because I scared somebody would do it again. That is why I have patience."
