"The time I was patient was whene I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training, he was there for like @NUM1 months. At the end if they made  it through they got a award. So there was kind of a lot of  people. We had to dress really nice. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didnt even know. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient."
