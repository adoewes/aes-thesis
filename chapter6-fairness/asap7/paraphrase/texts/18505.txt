"I asked my mom if I can get a phone but she said no, not yet. She said I cant have one till @NUM1 grade unless I get a @CAPS1 phone write now and cant till ninth grade to get a real phone. I told her okey. But when are you going to get it for me. She said you have to be patient. I told her I will but when she said as soon as possible like on @DATE1 . I said I∆ll be patient till then and will not bug you about it. That∆s one time I had to be patient."
