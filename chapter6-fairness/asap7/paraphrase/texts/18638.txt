To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at a airport then canceld it was not very fun because I didn∆t eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my ds. The story was we went to @LOCATION1 on the @NUM1 for vacation to disney land. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security. When we got to the boarding gat we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed that ment we had to stay here in the airport. I aleast saw that we were going to new @LOCATION2 first then to @LOCATION1 but I stayed patient. Well that∆s the day I stayed very very patient.
