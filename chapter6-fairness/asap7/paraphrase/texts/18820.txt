"A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day she when I woke up I woke up to early. My aunt never told me what time she was coming. So I got ready at @NUM1 am. So at @NUM2 am I called her but she didn∆t answer. So then I just was watching, tv and playing my game. Then around @NUM3 pm my aunt called back sayin she had to go to the store. so now my fusteration started to build up. I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you goin and how long your gonna be gone. but I was trying to be patient. Now at @NUM4 my mom said lets go! Now I was really getting mad because I was not expecting to leave with my mom. So me and my mom got home at around @NUM5 pm. Now I was real angry because she had not even called since we was gone. So I called her and she said she comin down the street. I was so happy so later on that day I had fun with my couisins and aunt."
