"Patience is probalbly  one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probalbly like you more, for example, if you are in line for something at school, and you were patient, you will probalbly get a ô@CAPS1 youö from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park rideÆs line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldnÆt want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed. This is why I think patience is important."
