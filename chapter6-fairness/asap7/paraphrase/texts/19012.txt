"I played soccer for a rec.Team called the cheetahs. Rec means I was in the best division possible you could be in. Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and me were doing all the work no one else on the team were not doing anything. So I decide to go try out for a select team. A select team is in the second highest division you can be in. When try outs came I was really nervous. After I tryed out for three days, if you were selected you would get a phone call saying you made the team. It took long time to get a phone call it felt like it took a country. In between those days I had to wait and wait and wait and wait and so on, when you wait for a long period of time thats called patience."
