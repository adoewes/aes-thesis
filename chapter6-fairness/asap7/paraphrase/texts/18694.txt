"Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. ôAre you sure you donÆt want me to take him?ö I ask for the tooth time. ô@CAPS4, I got it!ö @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didnÆt have my arm being pulled off. ôAre you sure?ö I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. ô@CAPS5!ö @CAPS7 says lightly, ôI got it!ö @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day IÆve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. ôI think my hands are numbö I say joining them into my pockets. ô@CAPS6, at least itÆs not raining, like the weather man said, ô@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, ô@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!ö I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, ôDo you want me to take him!ö @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, ôI got it.ö"
