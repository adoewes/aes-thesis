"The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved foward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the piolt got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the plane∆s wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendents helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3."
