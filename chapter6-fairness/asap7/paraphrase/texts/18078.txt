"Have you ever been patient?  I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1∆s @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  I planned to got my @CAPS1 washed, deep-condioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. ÙI∆m sorry but @PERSON1 won∆t be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that you∆d like to do your @CAPS1?∆ A perplexed expression spread across my face. Ù@CAPS3 @CAPS4 here?ˆ I asked. Ùyes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three o∆clock. Ùshe suggested. Ùthat∆s fine.ˆ  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didn∆t get my @CAPS1 done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has it∆s advantages."
