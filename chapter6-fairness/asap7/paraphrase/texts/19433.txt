"When I hurt my hand on the same day of meaping, I was patient, I was patient. I fell in the hall and I went to the office, I waited patietly for them to call my mom. to pick me up. When my mom she said she was going to take me to the @CAPS1 room. It took a wile to find a parking spot when we got there, I was patient even though hand hurting. The we finally found one and then went inside. My mom went to the font desk to tell them I was there. We waited to a little while and then a nurse came out and use go in a room and talk, she said I would have to wait for a bed to open up for x-rays. I saw a lady through the window I knew it was for me, she opened the doors and asked for @PERSON1. She had us follow her to a room where we waited about forty five minutes for a doctor to come in and take us to the x-ray room. When they finished we went back to the room and waited a wile. Antill the doctor come in and said I didn't broke anything, he gave me a brace and I went home, @CAPS2 all of that I was patient."
