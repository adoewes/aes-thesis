"I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher∆s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher∆s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I∆d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That∆s not the only time but, it∆s the most longest time I was patient with some one."
