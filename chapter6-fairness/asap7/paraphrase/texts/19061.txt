"This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   get∆s you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you∆ll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you can∆t, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don∆t hurt their feelings if they can∆t do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don∆t get in trouble. If you wouldn∆t have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That∆s why you need patience."
