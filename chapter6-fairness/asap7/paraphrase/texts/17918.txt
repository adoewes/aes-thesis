"Patience is about waiting for something for a long  time. If you have patience that is good for you here is a time where i had patience. Last year in @DATE1 after school my dad and I went hunting for deer in @CAPS1. He went to this homeguards blind that we found sat in chair waiting for a deer to come along. You have to have patience while going  hunting . We didn∆t see anything but then a deer came along and my dad he got ready and he said Ùcover your earˆ then he shot  but we didn∆t see any sign of deer blood  so he must have missed,then we packed up and went home.That is the time i had patience to go hunting with my dad but we didn∆t get anything though."
