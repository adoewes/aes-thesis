"This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went off I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say usher tickets on sell that and then I frozzes to listen, the tickets were going on sell down town. I told my mom and she rushed in the car and got dozen there so fast you wouldn∆t even see us leave. When I got to the line it was so long it seem like it go on forever. I waited and waited it felt like it only moved on an inch. Ti waited and still waited I beagin to get mad but I stood in line. Which my long wait was over I begain to jump for joy. As I walked to the concer she said Ùsorry we are all sold out. I couldn∆t believe it I begain to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing it was so unfair. And that∆s the time I was patient for noting."
