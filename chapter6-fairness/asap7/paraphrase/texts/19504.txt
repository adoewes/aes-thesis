"My story is about a time when I was patient was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for ô@CAPS1ö to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldnÆt wait to go but I remembered to be ôpatientö.  The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to ô@LOCATION2ö when were in the car on our way there I couldnÆt wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldnÆt wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there.  I had to nare patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states."
