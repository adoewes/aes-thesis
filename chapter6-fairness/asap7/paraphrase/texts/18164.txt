Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesn∆t want to be at home because he mom don∆t let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.
