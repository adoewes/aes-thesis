"It was my first game. I was pumped ready to go in, coach yelled big guy and I was by his side. Then he said next play you re going in. Ther the assistant said no I wasn∆t aloud to. The whole time I didn∆t complain. I never said one word to anyone. I helped other people. It was still fun. The whole time at least I didn∆t complain and make it worth for everyone else. The whole time I was on the side lines. Never went in not ounce. I was very patient. Not to say I wasn∆t mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I suported my team mates. I encouraged. I help in any way shape or form. I listend to them complain. But I did give suport. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine. That one stupid word stood in my way no. But at least I learned something."
