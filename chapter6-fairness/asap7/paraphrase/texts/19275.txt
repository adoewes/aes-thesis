"Why wasn∆t my uncle there yet? Come on! I was saying there hade trapped bet up my back, falop used into the ?? and the only thingi had to call for help with was my cell phone. Where was uncle @PERSON1 @CAPS1 all I quick I∆ll look back to see what was wrong: I was at uncles house waiting for him to hurry up so could go hunting. I douln∆t wait. Opening the ?? door very quite  and ?? out with my @NUM1. Guage, I then ran out into work ans into my tree stand. We had had this stad for as long ?? could remember. That I now see ˚ was a bad thing. The ladder was ? and we felt like it would break. The top bowed and break quite a few time in different spot. We kept telling ourselves that we would rebuild it but we never got to it. So after climbing up the ladder I let the ? to my side and waited. Hunting required a lot of patience but I didn∆t need any. There standing on the horizon of tree, was the biggest buck I had ever seen, I almost said it was so beautiful. Loading a stud into the barrel I took aim ?? Boom I shoti zzz+++! I missed luck! The stud tilted to the side. I reached for the gun so I could put it on ??  ?? sown and even the edge. The gun landed bend ?? I turned even to see the stud coming down. I turned ?? si I was facing the ?? and tried to get up but I had spined my leg.Then with agreat crash!!! The stud fell into my ?? were trapped beneath my back I tried to move but my back hurt too bad and my ?? were starting to bleed.i was luck I didn∆t break my neck and so my problem esd I wasn∆t patient at first. But I learned my lesson and wanted andwas patient enough to wait until my uncle was within yelling distance. I got in trouble, and learned the hard way to be patient"
