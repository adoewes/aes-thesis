"I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the beginning of the @NUM1 grade. I had enrolled in band that year, playing the trumpet. We played songs and had tests to everyone we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something funny on my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long  private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school. I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me  the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again and together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them being ?? patient with me. Then  finally I was playing every note .The lesson was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now i play my notes right that∆s to the lesson and @PERSON1∆s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>∆s patience to come out or there is ?? required classes."
