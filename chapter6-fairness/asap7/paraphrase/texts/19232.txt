"One day when I was patient is when I was waiting was waiting @CAPS1 @NUM1 to come out of game stop. One day til  @CAPS1 @NUM1 come out I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said ô@CAPS2 must be a good gameö. So instead of waiting at game stop I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my xbox @NUM4 then I got tired , tired and more tired so I fell aslteep on my pep game chair  till the morning. My older brother woke up and said ôlets go to gamestop to get @CAPS1ö. So we went to game stop and waited in a long line for like an hour and thirty minutes til in was  are turn to buy @CAPS1 it  cost like @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 my brother had @MONEY1 he didÆnt wanna put no money in for the game and I said ôIÆll pay @MONEY3 and you will @MONEY1. So we brought the game and played it tell we beat it."
