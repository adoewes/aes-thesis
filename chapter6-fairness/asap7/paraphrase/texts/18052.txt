"A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip ,she moved slower than my grandpa you are probally asking yourself  hour does this make her patient ,@CAPS1 @CAPS2  had to follow her every where she went if @CAPS2 wasn∆t patient I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in @CAPS2 mean @CAPS2 took here almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom . Normally I∆m  not a patient person at all ,but when this  happened I had to be patient .I∆m  glad @DATE1 that I was  patient because now I am more patient then I was before .My mom is proud  of my behavior ,because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed @CAPS2 .Being patient is a good thing, you look at life  different .now I can imagine me being patient.i mean I∆m not glad my mum get hurt but I∆m glad of my consequence of the problem .After the big accident hapend I have learned  that everyone needs a little bit of patience like me that is one example about how I thought of  I small were here away ever  been patience ,without my mom."
