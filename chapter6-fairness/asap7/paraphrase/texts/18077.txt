"Time my friend was patient! one day it was @DATE1@NUM1.and that day was when report cards came out. My grades were good I had @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1, was failing. maths, she had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom see,s it she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tryed to cross it out and put an good grade but she knew her mom will find out. so she told her mom ôreport cards didnÆt come out yetö. And her mom believed her. So then she tried re printing it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and ôI told her my honest thought and I said @CAPS2ö. but ôif you dant wanna get in trouble then yeahö And she said. When her mom asked her ôdid the report cards come outö. She said ôyeahö then her mom found out its not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and  it was a fake grade. Then she got introuble and she was patient about it and she said the truth. Her mom went to the  office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she said the truth. ThatÆs a time were my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade.She still was honest, and patient about it. I know that it was wrong for me two tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wont get in trouble."
