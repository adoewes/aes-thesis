And I said I play winner @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON2 won and @PERSON1 didn∆t give me the controller and she wasn∆t sharing. @CAPS1 then I said she could play one more time then its my turn, instead she played four more times @CAPS1 I said @PERSON1 its my turn you played and I didn∆t, she said Ùit is not your turn.ˆ @CAPS1 then her mom said Ù@PERSON1 you can play @NUM1 more minutes then its @CAPS2∆s turnˆ one hour thirty minutes past and she still didn∆t give it to me @CAPS1 then I said @PERSON1 its my turn, and I∆ve been patient for a long time you either give it to me or I∆m going to take it, she still didn∆t it to me.
