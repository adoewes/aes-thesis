"On a morning @DATE1 when every one of my family members wake up at @NUM1 or @NUM2 oÆclock am. Me my brother and my sisters told my mom ôcan @CAPS4 play the @CAPS1 and the labtop.Æ @CAPS2 said sure but you guys have to wait until each otherÆs turnö and @CAPS4 said ôok.ö @CAPS3 the @CAPS4 played it. Each person had one and a half hour to play on both things .I let my brother and sister s play first because IÆm the oldder one and I have to wait ptiencetly until it was my town. Well until it was my turn @CAPS4 wood have to take playing the game on the things, @CAPS4 wold do that until the day was done. Or until tomoro was done. That wold be it until next @DATE2 or until @CAPS4 can play it again.  And thatÆs what I say I do as being patience at home and the respect my brother and sisters."
