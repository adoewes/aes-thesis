"There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldn∆t go on to the next part. Also we couldn∆t talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldn∆t talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didn∆t no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year. Every year I∆m alway patient. That a story on when I∆m patient."
