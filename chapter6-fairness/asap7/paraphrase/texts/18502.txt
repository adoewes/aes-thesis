"I v'e been waiting for like two hours. When am I going to get my food. I was hungry so I told my mom she asked me if I wanted to go out my cat I said sure and went and got my jacket on. Mom said I got to go get dad, wait in the car so I went and waited for them for like a minutes. When they finally got out dad asked ?????????Shouted @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He said ok and we went. when we  got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside there were like a billion people in there. I was so hungry I could eat a pig. Metarorickly speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about @NUM1. I started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about an hour. Before some people left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't ever talk at all, and I talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient."
