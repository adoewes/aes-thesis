"A time that I was patient was last year at cheer competition. In the beginning of the day I was patient getting in line to get ready to perform. Once we were ready we were waiting to go to perform. After, we perfomed we went to watch the rest of the teams. The other teams were really good. Then are team went and had lunch while some of the teams were still performing. We had to wait til all the teams were done. Once the teams were done they called all the squads to the mat it was award time. All the teams sat down on the mat. My team members were waiting patiently to see if we worn in cheer or in dance. We waitedà and waitedà and waited till finally he called are name. The junior varsity cheer leader! We took first in dance and fourth in cheer. That day was a good day for me and I was very patient and being patient can turn out right or not the way you wanted it to be. You never now till it happens. That is a time when I was patient at cheer competition."
