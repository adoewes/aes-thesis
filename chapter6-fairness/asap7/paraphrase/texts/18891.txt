"Patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something . Some people can be very, very patient. But other people have no patient at all. Like if your waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of thing an your in a bit of a rush. Now yo could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut. That∆s what patient is to me."
