"Patience can really help you in life some times it∆s the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and I∆m waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you'll get in a sitchation were your waiting for someone but there is always only one choice, to wait or be patient."
