"A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we where waiting I keep asking my mom ""when are we going when are we going."" When the said ""@CAPS1"" i waked into the room. I asked if i was going to hurt and they said you won't fell a thing."" The doctor put a tube on my mouth and said close your eyes and breath. with out even knowing I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours and when I wanted to get out of the chair they said ""no, no, no"" so I sat and sat until @NUM1 minutes later they let me out I was all loope and had to be put in a wheel chair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys and my mom gave me wresteler. When we where about to leave my mom talk to the doctor and they took for  ever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheel chair back and we where off. during the ride my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day cause of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror but I did and it was grass. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks d so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat I was happy. I am still patient cause the doctor said that grawn up teeth would come in a few months but it has been two years and nothing so I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get bcacies which is gonna hurt really bad."
