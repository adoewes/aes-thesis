"Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn∆t just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when your waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience."
