My mom is very patient. The reason why my mom is patient is because when she goes to the beauty shop she calls @NUM1 hours of waiting not a long time. Another reason she is patient is because if I don't do my chores she dozent get very upset she just ask me to do it again. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work because she does not get frustrated when  she has a lot of work to do like writing  a @NUM2 word paper
