"When I was patient. Their was a time when I was patient. Their are more and more wayÆs I get @CAPS1 patient when IÆm not in no hurry to do something. IÆm going to tell you a true story when I was patient. And I was not in a hurry in get it done. My first day at school and we was having fun with a bunch of people and on that first day we had work. When we attended to do it some people was not patient. I looked around the bright room and I was thinging about how should I be patient, ô@CAPS1 I saidö to myself I have to take the time @CAPS1 I could reach a good grade and @CAPS1 I was patient. The next day I was ready to see my grade on that work. I had a fun thatÆs the day when I was patient and taking my time."
