"It was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank hot chocolate. I saw our @DATE1 tree is was full of presents, I couldnÆt wait till I could open them. IÆve been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didnÆt stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. ô@CAPS1ö I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied ô@CAPS2 canÆt afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. ô@CAPS3ö thank you ômomö I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the?? I got the wii and it ??, which was @MONEY1. I couldnÆt believe it, my patient finally paid off. Now I got my new wii, and @CAPS4 enjoying every second of it."
