"A time when I was patient was when I preordered a videogame called @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I preordered it a month before it came out and I couldn∆t wait for it to come out. I mostly wanted it because @ORGANIZATION1 is the company that makes it and this is the last game @ORGANIZATION1 was making because some other company bought the @CAPS1 series from @ORGANIZATION1. When the game finally came out on @DATE1 fourteenth two thousand ten, I bought with my friends and the game is amazing. I would give it four of five stars. I∆m not absessed with it through. I play it only about two hours a day which is all my parensts let me play any way. Hala @CAPS2 is my very favorite game."
