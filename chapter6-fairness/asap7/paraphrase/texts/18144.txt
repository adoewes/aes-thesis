"A time when I was pacient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was  babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too."
