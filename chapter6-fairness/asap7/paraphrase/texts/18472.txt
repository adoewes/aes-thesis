"I was patent when I was waiting for a chance to go to cicago. I really wanted to go see the windy city because my mom went to @LOCATION1. I tried to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked but once in awhile it came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didn∆t bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I keept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didn∆t care about @LOCATION1. No mater how tempting it was seing @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 hawks game on I kept my cool. Then it happened @MONTH1 @DATE1, imagen that it was @NUM1 and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nut shell no mater how long it took, I would be patient."
