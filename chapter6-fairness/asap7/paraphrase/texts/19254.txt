"Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who ôclaimsö to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is ôbe patientö! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isnÆt up yet."
