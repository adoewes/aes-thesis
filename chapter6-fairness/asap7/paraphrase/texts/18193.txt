"I donÆt have much patience, but IÆll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was @DATE1 after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to landslide skate park. We were all at my home but @CAPS1 wasnÆt. My mom said ô@CAPS2 hes not here in two minutes we have to go with out himö. So I was mad I was writing a note to put on the door that reads ô@CAPS1, we had to go with out you because you were late! Sorry be on time next time.-@CAPS4ö. But when I was signing the note he pulled up. That was the story when I had patients."
