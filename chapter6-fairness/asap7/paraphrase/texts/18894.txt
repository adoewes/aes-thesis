"It was a hot @DATE1 day in @CAPS1 my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. We went on all of the rides. Our last one was the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The line was short when we were walking there. Once we got there the line was all the way to the train. It was like waiting for a pig to fly. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots. When we got back my parents were another back. ""@CAPS4 are we so far back?"" my brother said. My parent got out of line so they could get a drink. Ten families wanted got in line. We waited and waited until, something spontanious happend to us. The ten families were is the wrong line so we got to be in front (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun it was worth waiting."
