A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didnÆt always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words ôpractice makes perfectö she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me.
