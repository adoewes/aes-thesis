"One time when I was patient was when there was a twenty two hour corride to florida. It was me, my cousin, my two sisters, and my parents. It was very boring. I was sitting in the back with my sister, and we kept fighting for foot space. Around five hours in, I was feeling cramped. We stopped off for dinner, then were on the road again. When it started to become night, the road froze and we stopped off and slept in the car. We woke up during sunrise and went to cracker barrel for breakfest. It was delicious. Then we got back into the car and drove the rest of the way to florida. It @MONTH1 have been a long drive, but it was worth it."
