"Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. So she was phoneless for aleast three months. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first @CAPS1 and a webcom. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn∆t be able to wait that long."
