"One night when I got home from cheer I was starving, and the dinner wasn∆t even on the grill. We were having steak, brown rice, and mack and chees. To past time I went upstairs to take a shower I took ten minutes to take a shower and it still wasn∆t ready. So I did some homework. I did math, reading, and I study for a test. The mack and chees was ready the steak was almost ready and the brown rice wasn∆t even close to being ready. I was so hungry and tried, but I keeped my patient. Oh my gosh the food smelt so yummy. I wanted to eat right then. I was so hungry that I had to put gum into my mouth to keep my mouth busy. Two minutes later the steak was ready mack and chees was ready but we are still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and pourd our drinks I still had my patient. Five minutes later the food was ready. All four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate. Oh my gosh it was so yummy. I had two little pieces of steak, three scoups of rice, I love rice, and a tiny piece of mack and chees. The dinner was awesome. After that dinner I went strait up to bed."
