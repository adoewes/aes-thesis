"When I was @NUM1 years old my mom use to be unpatient all the time and got so annoyed at! But then one day she was going to take a shower but then people kept on going and she got patient for a while and I got up there. I saw her and hide. As I peeked from end to end she was still standing there, almost falling asleep and she was still patience. Another stepped in the bathroom and I quickly went there and said ô@CAPS1, excuse me but my mom is coming, sheÆs been waiting. So I woke up my mom ômom, mom wake up go take a shower!ö and she woke up and took a shower, after she came out ôahhö it kind of feel goodö that was better.ö The end."
