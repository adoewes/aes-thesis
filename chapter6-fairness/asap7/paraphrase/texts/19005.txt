"My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it∆s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn∆t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave."
