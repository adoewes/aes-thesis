"Patience is like waiting for something and not froaring out. Imagine if no one had patience everything would suck. Picture this your at the store there is a line at the register, no patience and people are fighting to get to it. Knowing that most people have patience that would not happen. Since the people have patience the world has order so if you think about it it's a good thing."
