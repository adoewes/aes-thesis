"One time I went in the @CAPS1 and I had to sit in the visiting room/ area for about @NUM1 min- @NUM2 mins. I really didn∆t care, because I had to go to school after I was done you could tell any me in was not very happy because your only sapose to be waiting for @NUM3 minutes. I finally got in and went to sit in the chair and they took my rubber bands off and I had to sit there and wait for about @NUM4 minutes. I was still being patient, because I didn∆t want to go to school. I don∆t like coming in the middle of class, because everybody stares at you. The doctor finaly came to check on me then I got different color rubber bands on. Also the doctor  came to see me and see if my bracese were all right. I finaly got out of the @CAPS1 oficce and it was about @NUM5 so I got to go home and I was happy."
