"I wondered who would win. I just hoped I would. I was nervous. I was also a little bit scared. I didn∆t know what was going on to happen. I was very patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. I was waiting  for the contest to end .A little bit earlier I played the game. I was currently in first place .I was nervous .I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @LOCATION1∆s @CAPS3. I sat quietly in a chair. I tried not to show that I was nervous. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom said we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the tilt I whirl. I was wondering if anybody beat my score during the whole ride. Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too. I was very anxious I want to do it again some time. I told you when I was patient. When were you?"
