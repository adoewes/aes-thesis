"ô@CAPS1 !Did it came yet!?ö I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop.She was I n standing from the mail box, holding a thick wad of envelopes .One of these, I hoped was the letter. ô@CAPS2 yet honey ,ö she said ôbut thereÆs plenty of bills to go around.ö  I wanted  to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said ,ö  just wait long  enough and youÆll get what you wantö  I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesnÆt sound that important but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results .Pretty good system ,huh? No ! Pretty soon, other things distracted me swim meets, tennis, book, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the coner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!"
