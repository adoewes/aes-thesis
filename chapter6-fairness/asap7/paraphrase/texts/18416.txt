"One time when I was patient was when my mom∆s car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited an hour and a half waiting on her. My mom called called her back and she said she can∆t make it because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way to @NUM1 mile and @PERSON1 where the was another bus that took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1 where my school is. That was time when I was patient."
