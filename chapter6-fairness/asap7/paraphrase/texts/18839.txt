"ô@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon donÆt worry,ö @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaing. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called ô@CAPS3ö person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didnÆt come in the mail. IÆve been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didnÆt. ôIÆve been sitting here since ten oÆclock where is the @CAPS4 track!ö I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! ô@CAPS5 comingö I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7  truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 thatÆs it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps.ö @CAPS10!ö I sob in agony, ô why does this feeling consume me like this?ö I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. ô @CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!ö I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally!"
