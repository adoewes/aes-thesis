"The time when I was patient was when we went to the mall to go get my customized hat. This is the only time when I was patient. I went to the store called lio's. I picked out my hat and everything. So I said I wanted saad on their he did everything then I asked how long he said @NUM1 mineuts. We went around the mall and went back to the store that took like @NUM2 to @NUM3 mineuts. So I asked the guy is it done he said ""not yet"" I was watching him doing another guys hat. So he stopped the other guys hat, I didn't wanna make a scene and yell at the guy so I'm waiting and waiting until he's finally done with the hat that took about an hour. So I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat & I was happy."
