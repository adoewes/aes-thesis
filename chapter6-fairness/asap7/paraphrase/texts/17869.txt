Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. I have been patient many times. For instance when my mom uses the phone late till she gets of to talk to her. Before events like plays or movies you have to be patient until the movie are play begins. I am most patient during tests. Like this one the mean patience is very important. If you dont have patience to some people that is anrcoying. If i didnt have patience I would be a completely???person people would mind me very amount and every they would @CAPS1 get along with me so inside of bothering someone @CAPS2-stop be patient.
