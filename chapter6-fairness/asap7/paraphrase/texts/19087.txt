"A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldn∆t just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world."
