"ôWhen can I drive?ö I wined. ôwhen the time comes you have to be patient, otherwise you wonÆt yelled my @CAPS1 over the loud, heart warming sound of @CAPS2. Starting up for the @NUM1 time that year. I loved that sound. ItÆs my second favorite sound. The vibrations rattaling my lags as it races away with @PERSON1 driving. I could wait until my turn. After I rides and @NUM2 mins. @CAPS1 said the words I thought heÆd never say,ö @CAPS3, your turn.ö I looked at him then the truck. Wow does he look small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climed onto the tires rim, then to the, top of the tire, and into the cab. ô@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, gaggag @CAPS7. Oh yeah! This felt right. I couldnÆt go fast but I almost tipped it over. So thatÆs a good thing. So all in a nat shell, paconts comes a long way."
