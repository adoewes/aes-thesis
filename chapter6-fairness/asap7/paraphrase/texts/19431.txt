"Where here at cedar point. I was so excited I felt like I was going to go cyco ôcan we go on the dragster first.ö @CAPS1 why not it`ll be fun when we got in line. It was a estimate of and hour wait. ô@CAPS2 do you still want to ride the ride,ö sure I do, so I knew I would have to be patient before I could ride. While we waited, it was hot and when I when @NUM1 went by it felt like and hour !but I knew when it was time patience would pay of. When @NUM2 minutes pasted the dragster was in sight n cling cling we were second in line. Zoom! a carx went by, pimaly a blue long dragster car stoped  and it had my name all over it I got in and in was so patience it was like @NUM3 minutes before the ride started, @NUM4: @CAPS3. At @NUM5 we went up the hill and was like a meteorite crashing down into earth. When it was over my patience payed off and @CAPS4 always patient because of the cedar point dragster."
