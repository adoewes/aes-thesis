"One of the many times I was patience was when my @CAPS1, my @CAPS2 and I went to a restrant. We oderd our food and found a tabil. We were siting there waiting  for the food. I ask my @CAPS1 ""@CAPS3 much longer its going to take?"" @CAPS4 said ""you have to be pactien and waitie"". And then a little after the our food was done. It was toatlly worth it."
