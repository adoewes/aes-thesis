"There are many time @CAPS1 a persons life when someone was being patient. Patient @CAPS1 a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There @CAPS1 a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful. Like I said, being patient @CAPS1 a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it."
