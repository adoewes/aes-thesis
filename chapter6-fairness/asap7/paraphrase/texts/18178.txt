"Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I∆ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I∆ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I∆m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I∆m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she∆s transferred everything, I∆ve proved I∆m deticated, I∆ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I∆ve been watching the neighbor∆s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I∆m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I∆ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn∆t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I∆ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I∆ll have to continue everything I∆m doing now. So, I won∆t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!"
