"There were many times when I was patience. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your home work. Maybe waiting days for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. @MONTH1 be waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patience to get my first dog. @CAPS1 was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldn∆t find the right one. @CAPS1 took @NUM1 weeks til we saw the cutest chichuacua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him. When we turned @CAPS1 in the lady said we had a back side too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had  to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2 we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog.We didn∆t find one, but we waited and if your patient you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow @CAPS1."
