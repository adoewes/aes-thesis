"A time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to get the money for our chiuahuce @CAPS1. It was @DATE1 and my dada sold his giutar to his uncle to get money for the day of coarse he didn∆t have it. A day went by and still nothing. When my mom came and picked his ??? I went to swim practice trying to be patient and wait for my dad to get the money. At around @NUM1∆oclock my dad called saying he won∆t get the money till @DATE2 @TIME1! I was mad, but still tried to be patient. A few days went by and soon it was @DATE1 again. I was so excited. We finally got @CAPS2 I had been patiently waiting for a week and was tired of it. So when I was him my patience was worth it. That was the time I had to be patient for something good.It had really paid off."
