I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and the incredible. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilerious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future.
