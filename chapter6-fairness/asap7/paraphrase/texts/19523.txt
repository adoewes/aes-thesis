"A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to @LOCATION1, really it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn∆t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at @ORGANIZATION1 since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while. I had a really fun  time in @LOCATION1!"
