"I am patient wherever I go to the dentist∆s office, orthodontist, or doctor∆s office. The first time is at the dentist∆s office when I have to wait to get my teeth cleaned. I usually sit there and end magazines .The next place I am patient is outhodontist,I sit and wait in the first room and crater to my I-pod after a few minutes the call me into the second room where I wait little longer to get my bracer frightened . Once I get in the office I have to wait for the guy to tighter them. Finally there is the doctor∆s office where you sit in the big waiting foom for a long time and wait for the lady to call you in when you get there if you are getting shuts you have to wait patienty for the doctor to being them. As can see a lot of things take patience."
