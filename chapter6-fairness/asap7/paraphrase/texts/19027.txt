"I have to be patient when I∆m taking the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I∆m patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .I sometimes have to wait forever .But that∆s fine I can just take a nap .I sometimes hate being patient .It just frustrates me .Waiting for like @NUM1 minutes just for people to finish a test .It∆s good because you shouldn∆t rush on the @CAPS1. Its justs frustrates me that people take so long .It∆s not just at school it∆s at my house too. The doctor, dentists at a friends house and and at the library. Man this is so hard to be patient .But it∆s not good  to be  in patient .I wish people were as fast is  I am during a test .Then I wouldn∆t have to be very patient.O well I guess I∆m just going to deal with it man this really stinks being so patient."
