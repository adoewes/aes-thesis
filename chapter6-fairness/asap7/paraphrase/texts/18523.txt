"Everybody loves @CAPS1, and they all have to be patient for it. Especially on the @TIME1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS3. Everybody in my family always gets very excited and can∆t wait until morning, especially me. I get so excited I can hardly sleep. In fact, last year had to be the hardest. It was @NUM1 am on @CAPS1 morning and I had woken up for no reason. I decided to go back to sleep and did for only about thirty minutes when I woke up again. I just couldn∆t fall asleep! I went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep when I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there. I sat up and looked around at them. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait until everyone woke up. So I tried to go back to sleep. I would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying. It was @NUM2 am. I turned on the @CAPS5, threw in a movie, and waited. At @NUM3 am most of my brothers were up and I couldn∆t take it anymore. I snapped and started to complain. I had become very impatient. I finally was told yes and began to open my presents. I was finally happy."
