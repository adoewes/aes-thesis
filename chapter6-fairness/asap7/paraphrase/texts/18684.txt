One time I was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least @NUM1 hours. We were in the car on our way to @LOCATION1.  I was waching my dog on my lap for the @NUM2 hour.  The second hour I was sleeping.  The third hour I was waching a movie and by this time I had to go to the bathroom really bad.  Then by the last hour in a half I was to leget tearing up I had to go so bad t by the time my mom got off the phone we were at my aunt∆s house. I leget ran in t ran into the bath room and then I was fine.
