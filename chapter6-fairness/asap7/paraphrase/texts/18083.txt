"The one time I was patient was when I was waiting for the new game kill zone @NUM1. I had to come up with @NUM2 bucks. @NUM3 lt for the game and @NUM4 to put it on hold for me I got it the minute the store hade it in the shelvs. The maneger was poking them out so I grabed one and bought it. I went home ploged in my pss and started playing online. I now have @NUM1,190. Merged all together, the game is realy hard a day one or there was store manegers there one in the back. I do not suggest the game for all are under @NUM6."
