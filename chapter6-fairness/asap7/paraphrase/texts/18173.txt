"When I was about nine years old. I took my homework home with me. I showed one of my older brothers, my homework. He look at it then he started helping me with it. Then he did a couple of answers. To show me what I had to do because I didn∆t really know how to do my homework. So he had to do his homework so he told me to do my home work. So I started to do my homework I did all of my questions correct. But it was a realy hard question on it. T wanted to ask my older brother. But instead I didn∆t do that because he was doing his work. So I did it myself."
