One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easly devoloped a nice windup and delivery but the arin angle was off. But this didn∆t stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said Ùno!ˆ @CAPS2 time went on @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fasiball at a cetcher. On day∆s that he∆s unaccurate he doesn∆t gave he keeps trying and doesn∆t wine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some seltons patience.
