"One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He thougt that everything he wanted would come to him right a way. His name was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 soon reliesed that not everything came right when he wanted it. So he got really mad when he saw a house for sale, it was a really nice house. But the people living in the house weren∆t done moving everything out of the house. Then he discovered that patience is key and that when it∆s time to move in he will. So from that point on he was always patient for the rest of his life."
