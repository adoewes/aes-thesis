"The time I was patient was when my sister droped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Everyday for the rest of that week I was good. I still didn∆t get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her faught, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didn∆t. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and that∆s the time I was patient."
