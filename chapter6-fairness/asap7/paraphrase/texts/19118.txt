"I was at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on I was a huge line! It was like a big line of domminus. I do not like waiting in big lines. Like most kids, I dont wine and fuss about waiting. In my head IÆm thinking when I whould get to go on the ride. I dont scream and shout though, I just try to stand still and wait. The second go on. tic tac tic tac. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later it was finnaly my turn to go on the rollercoaster I was so exited! I went on the ride, it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute! that line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Well on well. That line was worth it."
