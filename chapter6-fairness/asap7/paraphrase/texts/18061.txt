So I went and  so did my  grandma, mom, my other sister my # @CAPS1 and  my sister @CAPS2  the one who is having  the baby. Boyfriend. There whe lots of people the and not all of use could go in at the same time I was to young to see the baby born but I didn∆t want to. My sister got mad because she couldn∆t go in there either so she left but I stayed it was boring. But I stayed I went in the  room to visit it  took  @NUM1 hours for the baby to be  born  we  went at nine  the  baby was  barn around @NUM2 I went home  to sleep  at  @NUM3 and  went  back  ve there  at  @NUM2:00  we  seen  the  baby at  @NUM5 his name was @CAPS3  he is so cute and  I∆m so glad to be his @CAPS4.
