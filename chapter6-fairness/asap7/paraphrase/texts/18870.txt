"Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of the soccer refs blowing their whistle for sub`s. (I was playing defense.)  @CAPS1 was calling my name to take me off. When I got off the field I got my water bottle and sat on the subed in until finally I asked my coach if a could go in. his response was you just got off. In my mind I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in. when I got on the field realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back in, he said sure. When the game was over I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This is a time I was patient."
