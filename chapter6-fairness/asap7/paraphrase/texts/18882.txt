"That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game."
