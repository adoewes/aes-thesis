Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient for the past couple years. He did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their @CAPS2 and see what the end result was. The @ORGANIZATION4 ended up going @NUM1 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3 they got the second pick in the twenty tend @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft the @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5 an defensive lineman out of the @ORGANIZATION2. He is an outstanding player and the @ORGANIZATION4 other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out of the @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team is so good this year because of @PERSON1's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents.
