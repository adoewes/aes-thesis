"Have you ever have to wait in line to get on the biggest roller coaster at a theain park? Have you ever wait until all your chores are done before you can play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I will tell you about one time that I had to be patient. During @DATE1 I had to go to the doctor to get shots @CAPS2 that I could be safe. When I got to the doctor I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was @CAPS2 boring! And I was thinking, ô@CAPS1 long does it take for a few people to get shots @CAPS2 that I can leave?ö @CAPS2 I had to just sit there for about half- an- hour until my name was called. Then once I got into a back room I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end I got to go home and play with my friend. This is once of many times that I had to be patient. And at least I still got to play with my friend. I hope you liked it."
