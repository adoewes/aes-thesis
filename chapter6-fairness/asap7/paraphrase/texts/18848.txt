Pg @NUM1: @CAPS1 her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldnt even more our arms I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was @NUM3 oclock in the morning and I saw a big sign that read welcome to @CAPS2. So at that point we only had a hour or so left I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4?@CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!
