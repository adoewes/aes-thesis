"A time that I was patient was during the @DATE1. My @CAPS1  @PERSON1 was nice enough to invite me to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with her family acoarse my pacents said yes. It was a @NUM1 hour @CAPS4 I think to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS7 it was fun cuz we brought lots of things to keep us buisy, we watched a movien on my @ORGANIZATION1, listened to music I had no trouble waiting till we got there. When we got to the hotel we picked are bads then jumped in the car to go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @NUM2 awesome. First few went on the @CAPS10 my eyes were watering it was so scary, then the music, it was so fast I felt like we were going to fly of the tracks. Next we we wanted to go on the malliniom force @CAPS7 the line was a hour long and we were in the middle of it. So it would useless to try to escape the line, then finally it was areturn to go, @CAPS7 it wasn∆t working so we had to wait, it wouldn∆t copperate so he told use that we can get free passes to go on any ride, and cut ahead of everyone @CAPS7 we only got to do it once. As you see us being patient , rewanted us, I think it was so worth it!"
