"I have patient until @DATE1 vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until @DATE1 arrives. @CAPS1 example, last year I was on the honor toll @NUM1 times. Over the @DATE1, if I have to do back regards or a @DATE1  patient, then I will do it and I won∆t leave it @CAPS1 the last minute. Then, I∆ll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I∆ll also wait until @DATE1 again. But in between we have some breaks and days off, I think we yet have enough assignments throughout the years, start we go school @NUM2 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, @CAPS1 example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so principal doesn∆t take our privellages away, @CAPS1 example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, she∆ll take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be @CAPS1 nothing. That really wouldn∆t be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble."
