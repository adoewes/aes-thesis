Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. I∆ve been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til∆ closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.
