"Two years ago my dad had surgery on his because he broke it at work .I had to sit in a waiting  room  for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do .Every two hours my mom ,grandma ,grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch .After about four hours I got really  tired ,but didn∆t fall asleep .That was the longest I∆ve sat in one place my entire life .At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half it only seemed like two ."
