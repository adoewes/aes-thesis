"Patience. Being patient means that you needs to make and dor one' thing constantly to make one????understand. That is patience. My mom is patient. When I dart understand a problem, she will explain @CAPS1 to me, never in rush. She don't yell a t me when I don't understand, unlike my dad, who is very impatient. He would yell, and possiblely cursed at me in chinease. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. But my mom will contune explain to me until I understand what @CAPS1 means. Some people @MONTH1 be impatient because of triats or because that he or she has high blood pressure. Patience is something my people have, but @CAPS1 seems like even move people lacks @CAPS1."
