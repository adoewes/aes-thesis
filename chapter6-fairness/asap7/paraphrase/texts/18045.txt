"Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called @CAPS1Æs @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  ô@CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes ??????  And I do not want to be late for school againö. I hollered at my @CAPS4 ô@CAPS1ö, @CAPS4 said in a hustled voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesnÆt take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient.ö ôI know, I know, I sighed but I still donÆt want to be lateö ôI know but remember, being patient will get you far.ö ô@CAPS6ö I agreed. So that @CAPS3 at school @CAPS1 remembered her moms words and was very patient all @CAPS3. She didnÆt whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didnÆt cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didnÆt grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldnÆt be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on."
