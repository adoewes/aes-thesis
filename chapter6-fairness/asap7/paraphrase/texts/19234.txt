"Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every mustle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crows. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And than I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn∆t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening."
