My story of when I was patient was when me and my family were going to the monster jam. It was one of the most exciting things of my life. But the trip there was almost @NUM1! then it took half an hour to find a place to park. Then eleast @NUM2 minutes for my moms friends to show up. And finally an hour in line. Last but not leas @NUM3 minutes to find our seat! thank you for listening to  my report about patience and sitting through it!
