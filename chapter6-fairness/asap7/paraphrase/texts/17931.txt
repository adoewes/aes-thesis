"Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know lur lne being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from mom il just not pretty. But one time l really had to use my patience. Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at kings' island @NUM1 hours just to go on illegible. Socio. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes maybe @NUM3 minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left us was nicor because me line shortned some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting debating on wheiner or not. We wanted to stay or leave we ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space snottle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally. The out was over! Using my patience and waiting inline forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride."
