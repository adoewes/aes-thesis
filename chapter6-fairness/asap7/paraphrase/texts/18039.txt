"One day we were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 for a very special event to see the president of the united states of @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 when we got to the park where we going to see him there were cars parked a mile away! When we finally parked the car we started walking it was a long walk but when we finally got to the gate I was excited! after we got through security we though we would never get there. Me and my parents stood in that I think for about two hours until finally everybody spread out and look their places sang the national anthem the president stepped up to the podium and gave along speech. It was the longest line I ever stood in and I was very patient."
