"Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old I was extremely patient about an @CAPS1 toy I wanted. Ever since @CAPS1 The @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 bender was on television and In stories now I was crazy about them and I still am today the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 the only person in the @CAPS1 world who can master all four element @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 . Now I can write you a whole entire book about the @CAPS1. So I saw a @CAPS1 had set on t.v. so I asked my mom could she buy it. And she said when I get the money, but until then no. so of course I was upset. So I was waiting counting until the days went buy. Then final that very @CAPS12 came, and you know what that means. ô@CAPS11 @CAPS12ö the @CAPS12 has arrived the @CAPS12 I get my toy but I didn`t know that she only got two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the @CAPS12 and when my birthday was here can guess whatà? I finally got the best of all. The @CAPS4 and my mom said that all that patients you did got what you wanted."
