"One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out my slurpee and inline to buy my slurpee. then an old lady got in line. So to be nice I let her in front of me. @CAPS1 a while she found out that she was a dollar short. So I gave her a dollar. She turned to me said thanks and gave me a mint @CAPS1 I bought my slurpee, me and my friends had to cross the road. We sat their for @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road and walked to my house. On the way to my house my friend hold to use the restroom. So we went to the market. We had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market. he told us he got lost. We walked home and on that day, I learned that it∆s tough to be patient."
