"A kid in my school, @PERSON1, has had a crush on my best friend my coarse for who knows how long. He has asked her about fifty times. She likes him as a friend but nothing more. She has dated many guys since @PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela can be a little boy obsessed.In fact she is now dating a boy who I asked out two days ago, sorry of topic. Anyway, @PERSON1 is always very patient, hoping mycaela will come around someday. It∆s been almost two years with him stalking her and she still hasn∆t come around. I just think that @PERSON1 is very patience and be is a great kid."
