"There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person."
