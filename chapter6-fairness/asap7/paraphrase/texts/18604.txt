"I must admit there are times when I∆m not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was.I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My told me to be patient but I didn∆t know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, ÙYou have to wart quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her. I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also."
