A time when I was patient was when I went to sedar point. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and it was a long ride. When we got there it was a long line to get in. My mom said ôall right guies time to be patientö. Once we got in we went to the first rid we seen. It also had a long line. Mom said ôwe are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the ridesö.
