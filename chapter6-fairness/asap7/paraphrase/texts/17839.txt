"It can be very hard for somebody to be patient. If you are patient, then you are understanding and tolerant. You have to be patient sometimes. When you go to the dentist or doctor∆s office, you need to be very patient. There was a girl who had to go to the dentist. She hated the dentist. It was always so boring. First, youÊd sit there while your parents did a whole bunch of paperwork. You have to just sit there for like @NUM1 minutes before you even go in. Then, when you finally go in, they start working on your teeth for like ten minutes, then you∆d sit there for another fifteen minutes. Finally, When you are done getting your teeth cleaned you∆d sit there for another ten minutes while your parents talk to the dentist. So, you need to be patient sometimes, even when you are just dying of boredome."
