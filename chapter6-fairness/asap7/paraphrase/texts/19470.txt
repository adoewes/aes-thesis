"There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up it∆s distracting. Now that you∆ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Let∆s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten"
