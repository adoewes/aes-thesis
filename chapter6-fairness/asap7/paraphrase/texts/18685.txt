"Im @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasn∆t told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience. I learned that."
