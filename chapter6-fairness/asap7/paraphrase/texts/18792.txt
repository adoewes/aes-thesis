"Every year since I learned a bout @LOCATION1 and presents, now that I think about they never said you∆d have to wait months until @CAPS1 came around. I love @CAPS1 but once a year or so @CAPS2 patient enough to wait until @DATE1 downward. The first @DATE2 of @DATE1 told me @CAPS1 was coming along with all we decorating ,carolling  and wistfull of @CAPS1 joy. I usually try to pass the time by having snow ball wars with my cousins. I still feel temptation trying to rush time and make me anxious and grueling to wait so long but @CAPS2 still patient and try to let the temptation go away. When @CAPS1 eve came I feel greatful I made it this long with patients because @CAPS2 just like my parents and cant wait for anything that takes month. Then it comes around as slow as possible and then leave quicker, then I could think how fast it left. Just like the saying time file sometime  having fan."
