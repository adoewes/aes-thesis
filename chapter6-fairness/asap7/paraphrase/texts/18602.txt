"My story is about a time I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was @CAPS1 and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn @NUM1 pm because my best friend @DATE1 was going to pick me up in her pink convertibable and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only @NUM2 so I did my chores thinking time will fly by so I did my chores. Instead of putting dish soap in the dish washer. I put grapes in the dish washer @CAPS2 the dish was hoe was done I empted it and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I  looked at the clock and it was only @NUM3 the I remembered that my favour  movie was on so I ran to my room but instead I ran into the wall and got knocked out. After @NUM4 hours I  was fine so I told my mom that I will be patient because I don∆@CAPS3 want to get knocked ???on the bright side I told myself I only have @NUM5 hours and @NUM6 minutes to go so I went to my room + wasted some @CAPS3.V. until eleven twenty so I had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating but first before I did my make up I whent into the kitchen I put all the grape smelling dishes in the dishwasher and washed them them the I right way. Then I put my costum on I was a bumblebee, then I put my make up on I looked so cool. Finally the clock turned to @NUM1 suddenley I heard a horn @DATE1 was here. So I got in the car + we went to pick cate. I almost forgot to tell you that @DATE1 was a ladybug, cate was a which so then we whent trick or treating. So thats a time when I was patient."
