"When I was patient. I was @NUM1 yrs old when I got a as. I ordered it online and waited. @NUM2 days went by and still nothing, a week went by and a ups truck stopped at our house dropped off the package and left. I was so happy that I didn∆t even noticed that it was for ma mom. I opened it to find pampered chef stuff in it. I was really angry! @NUM3 weeks went by and‡ nothing I was upset that I didn∆t really didn∆t know it I was gonna get about it. But a ups truck came and didn∆t see it and guess what in the package was my as! I didn∆t even realize it till @DATE1 I was so happy that I got it. That I forgot to order a game with it. And that was the time I was patient see ya."
