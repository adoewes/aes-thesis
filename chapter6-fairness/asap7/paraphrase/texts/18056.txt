"I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" @CAPS2 need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded."" @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?"" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3 brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. ""@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friend poured water purposely on @CAPS3 sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1""  ""@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do,"" @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. "" @CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened.""  I held @CAPS3 breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS5 filled in the next part, ""@CAPS12 you. Started punching him?"" ""@CAPS13, yes."" @CAPS14 admitted miserably. ""@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,""@CAPS15 scolded. ""I know, I know now. I 'm sorry,"" @CAPS3 brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16""I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day."
