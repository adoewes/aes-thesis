When I was patient. Was when I go down the river with my dad and my two sisters (@CAPS1 @MONEY1).The only way I'm patient is when my dad says we are going from north to @LOCATION1. So I have no chose to be patient because it is a two houre trip. But there is a train track brige that my dad least use @CAPS2 off of and tack a brake and eat some lunch and the brige is about one houre ride down the river if you realy all the way but whe just me and my dad go we just slot the hole way.
