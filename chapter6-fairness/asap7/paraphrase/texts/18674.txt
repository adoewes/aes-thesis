"My dad has a girlfriend named @PERSON1. She has two kids, one that∆s seven years old, and one that is four years old. The oldest one is @PERSON2, @CAPS1 loves to skateboard. The youngest one is @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 is kind of a spaz and if you jumped out of a airplane, @CAPS1 would too. This one day @PERSON2 and I were going to go skateboarding at a park, @PERSON3 wanted to come but @CAPS1 didn∆t even know how to ride a skateboard. @PERSON2 went over to the park and when we got there, @CAPS1 realized @CAPS1 didn∆t have his skateboard. I had to let him use my skateboard ??? ???. I didn∆t have a problem with him useing it, it∆s just that I didn∆t get to use it."
