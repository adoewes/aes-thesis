"Ok it was atime wen I was on a bus to got texas. My mom, and my family was going  to see my great grandfather. The bus smelt good but same lady kept spraying  perfume so i had to just sleep and snack on a couple snacks. I kept gettting woke up by a baby. Everytime  i hold to go to the  bathroom there was always someone in the bathroom. Also when i was trying to sleep every one seems to get louder. So when it was time to catch some  @CAPS1∆@CAPS2 my bus driver would wake us up us and we would have to get off the bus to another bus. It seemed  like  never on that bus. You had to have alot of patients or you wouldn∆t be able to to just relax when the day is done. I finally got there in @NUM1 days. It  was worth it because we went to six plags. If I didn∆t have patience then the experience of being on a bus for @NUM1 days would have been a horrible experience."
