"Patience, if you are a patient person you are tolerant and understanding. There was a time I was very patient. ""@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 go yet!? ""@CAPS2,"" she replied, ""@CAPS3 need to buy all of your school supplies."" I always didn't like back to school shopping. That would mean going with @CAPS1 to a store for @NUM1 hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencils binders and pens. ""@CAPS4 I really have to go too?"" ""@CAPS5 patient ok?"" ""@CAPS6, I replied. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I began to get more patient. Whenever I had to wait for @CAPS1. I just sat there, I just sat down and waited. And the day seemed to go by a lot faster @CAPS7 had been @NUM1 hours but @CAPS7 only felt like twenty minutes, when @CAPS3 left. I wouldn't wait till next year, I wanted to go shopping all over again!"
