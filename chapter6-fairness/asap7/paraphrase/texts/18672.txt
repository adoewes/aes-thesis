When I first saw my puppy @CAPS3 were at @ORGANIZATION2. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 brought over some dog to be rescued @CAPS3 saw all six dogs second one I saw I knew he was going to be mine. So @CAPS3 got him out the lady said that he∆s scared and he gets carsick but I didn∆t care he was my favorite. @CAPS3 said @CAPS3 wanted him so she told us to go to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and tell them @CAPS3 wanted @CAPS4 so @CAPS3 raced to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and on the way there @CAPS3 thought of names. My dad came up with the name @CAPS6 @CAPS3 liked it so that was his name I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home but as long as I got my puppy I was fine @CAPS3 got him a toy when @CAPS3 went back to see him I had it with every night knowing I was closer and closer to getting him the day finally came. @CAPS3 told my brother @CAPS3 were going fishing since he didn∆t know @CAPS3 were getting a dog. But once @CAPS3 there I ran inside to go see him @CAPS3 took him home he was afraid of everything even leaves outside. But @CAPS7 he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell @CAPS6 its bed time and I sleep with my wonderful @ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough patient is the key.
