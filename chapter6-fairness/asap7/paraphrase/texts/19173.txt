IÆm going to tell you about a time when I showed patience. When my family and my mom boy friend when on vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there it was pack full of people. So we jumped in line for the first ride. We were so excited that the @PERSON2 said @NUM1 teen minet wait. At first the line was moving very fast. There all of the sudden it moving like a sloth. It was so hot and humid that was alful. We checked the time it was @NUM2 minet already. It felt like @NUM3 hours. I was running out of pashents. Then we got in the shade it was a cool and nice. Finiy we were the next rid we got out the and one nice. @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 where so happy. My mom boy friend timed the rid it was only @NUM4 seconds long. We waited @NUM5 hour for a @NUM4 second rid. That was one time that I should patience.
