"Patient can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to resturaunts when we wait for our food I get board very easially. On time when I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot.@CAPS1 my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said ÙI don∆t think there is anything wrong, but we won∆t be sure.ˆ @CAPS1 she sent my mom and me to the urgent case out on @NUM1 with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty five minutes car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in we waiting in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while. I had to have patient because we were waiting there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle."
