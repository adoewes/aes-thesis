A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man although we got on his nerves. It we didn∆t understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I∆ve ever ???
