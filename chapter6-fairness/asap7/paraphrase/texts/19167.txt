"One of the worst fellings in the world is that your flight has been canceled .This has happens to many people but only one family in my family. My cousins were going to come to @LOCATION1 for chrismas. Cara and I where texting and e-mailing each other about what we where going to do while they where in @LOCATION1. They have been planning this since @DATE1, but now their night was conclled! We where so mad! My cousins family had to be so patence because they did not know if they would be coming to see us or not. My grandma kept calling my uncle @LOCATION2. My grandma had a good idea, for them! To get on the next fight. The only problem was that the next flight was at @NUM1 and it would take I them two hours to get here. When they got here I was at the airport waiting .When I saw my cousin she said ôeveryone was so patient but me!ö I expected the exact oposite but, no! I thought that my cousin, carn would be the patient one but I was wrong, but at least some one was pacient."
