"In my opinion, I am a very inpatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something , they∆d better stop it on the spot or @PERSON1 I rate, child makes a huge breakthrough, also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner, I snack my way to it! and when I am at school, I just @CAPS1 listening to meap instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy.! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage! Overall I think people need more patience these days."
