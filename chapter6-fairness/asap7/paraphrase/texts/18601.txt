"Patience is something you have to work on I do not have a lot of patience, I do not like waiting at all it is not fun .I do not like waiting ,because being patient is boring and five @CAPS2 feels like twenty @CAPS2. Then when you wait you start something and then as soon as you start its time. Waiting for package is the worst.  You wait and a sit and wait, then you forgot about it and then it comes .One day I was waiting to go to my friend house it felt like forever since IÆve seen her but it had only been about ten months .I missed her like crazy .We have been planning this ôor weeks it was finally the day of get to go over @CAPS1 .Now I was only waiting on my dad to drive me @CAPS1 and he takes forever .Finally we got in the??? We were waiting five @CAPS2??? Then he gets months??? and drove away .I swear we got shopped at every red light from my house to @CAPS3Æs house and got struck behind the slowest drivers so that made it werse .When we finally got @CAPS1 I jumped out of the truck ,@PERSON1 ran through the door down  then stars almost tripping down each one . She practically jumped on me we we hugging for like five @CAPS2. That is why IÆm not patient."
