"One @DATE1 week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over. We went to my @ORGANIZATION1∆s sisters house and my @ORGANIZATION1 and aunt (my @ORGANIZATION1∆s sister) were going to teach me hoe to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldn∆t do it for you. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited! When we got their after I had lunch they began teaching me. The tirck they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop(tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny loving around the tree. @CAPS1 you put it through (the bunny darling in its hole.) @CAPS1 you∆re bond. After many tries was starting to get the hang of it. Later we went back to my house and my @ORGANIZATION1 kept helping me. Finally one afternoon I got it, my @ORGANIZATION1 was happy and she kept telling me good job. Later we went to the store and picked something out! My @ORGANIZATION1 had to be patient with me. She wasn∆t getting all mad when I kept messing up she just kept being encouraging and patient. My @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and it helped me learn faster."
