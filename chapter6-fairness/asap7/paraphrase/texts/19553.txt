"One early @TIME1 in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 for a @ORGANIZATION1 skating competition I completed. I was waiting to hear if I made it to the @DATE1 part of the event. I had completed in. it was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We went get a bite to eat and went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend @PERSON1 also was in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the @DATE1, but I didn∆t know if I would or not. After a endless wait they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept saying over and over again in my head my number I was given.  They called @PERSON1∆s number. I was waiting for my number to still be called, but they never called it. I had not made it. I was disapointed, but I couldn∆t do anything about it."
