"A time when I was patient was when my favorit @ORGANIZATION1 of the year comes, the @ORGANIZATION1. I had waited patiently all year counting down the days till @DATE1 reading books and homework where almost done with for another year. You could smell the tension in the air as everyone watched the clock spin on the last @ORGANIZATION1 of school. As the hours went by @ORGANIZATION1, seconds, @CAPS1 , @ORGANIZATION2, every one grew restless, but I was patient; I sat, I waited, I listened, I read, but nothing  compared to hot final moment where the bell round and the students cheered. A smile on everyone∆s faces as they left the door for the final time that year."
