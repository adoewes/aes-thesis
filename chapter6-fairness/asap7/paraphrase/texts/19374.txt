A time when I was patience was on the car ride @LOCATION1. It was a @DATE1 hour car ride but I stayed patience I diden∆t complain. Most kids would say are we there yet but I diden∆t. Also when I was supper hungry I sat there and did not complain. Finally @DATE1 we got there. That is a time I was patience.
