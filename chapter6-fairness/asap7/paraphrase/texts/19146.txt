"ô@CAPS1!!ö I had another math home work assignment due tomorrow and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth grade teacher would give us math home work that was really long and hard. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home sit down at the table and take my time, and doing work. @NUM1 problems a day was hard for a fourth grader. Whenever math started I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terrible. @CAPS2 I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us as easy lesson and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a wile and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, ôbe patient and stay calm,ö @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem. Now to this day I remember to be patient. I also remember what we will have to live with being patient all our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out."
