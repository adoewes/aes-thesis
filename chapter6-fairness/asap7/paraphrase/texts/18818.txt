"My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience."
