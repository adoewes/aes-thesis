"Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great jorney to california. I had to stand in six very long line for up to @NUM1 hours it took forever to get on the plain when we finaly got there we were hungry so we had to wait inline for @NUM2 minutes when we were finally up to get our food we were starving we ate and went to a friends house we stayed  for an hour it started to get bouring but I had  patience and  waited  turns out it was not so bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life wether you are or arnt patient is up to you that week was all about patients and lines lots of both it was a long day. Sadly we had to leave after that day which equals. Yap you guessed it for patience first was had to go huston, texas then @ORGANIZATION1  then we had to drive  @NUM3 hours to get home when we got home we were so tired  and passed the story to my friends and family."
