Once in @NUM1 grade my teacher @PERSON1 ôasked us to get an A.M.P out.ö @CAPS1 we all did and quietly we started to work. All of a sudden I was on my last prebblem and I was thinking ôman already to the end.ö @CAPS1 I started to work on it I was @CAPS1 confused this probblem was like seventh grade work. @CAPS1 I rased my hand and waited to go on @PERSON1 my hand and told me to go on in my math but I told her ôI canÆt go on I am on my last problem.ö  @CAPS2 @PERSON1 went on helping all of the other students and I was waiting and waiting. Finally after she went to eight other people she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem and I figured it out. That was the time I waited patiently.
