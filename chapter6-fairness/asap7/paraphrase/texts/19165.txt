"Being patient is a hard task wright about. One day I was with my mom in @LOCATION1, looking for a pawn shop .We got stopped at nearly every red light on the way there .no one complained even when we reached a certain red light .Right before the light turned green a very old lady with a walker stepped infront of us we waited @NUM1 minutes for the old lady to pass .Supersising  still no one complained."
