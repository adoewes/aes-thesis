"Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadn∆t heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little it∆s been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn∆t have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The @CAPS3."
