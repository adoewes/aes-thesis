"Bang! I had just shot myself in the foot with a @CAPS1 gun. It all hapened when my sister got a gun for his birth day. I went up to a target and got ready to shout that was when I got shot I went to shout, that was when I got shot.  I went to my more and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor's office to have a look at my foot. The doctor had about @NUM1 or @NUM2 patients there not in in cluding me. My mom said"" @CAPS2 could take a while. I am a person with barely any patience at all. We waited, and waited, and waited for an hour. Today wasnt my kiday day. She called out a persons name it was hot mine. We waited for a total of @NUM3 hours and then the doctor finally called my name. After the @CAPS1 got removed I went home to sleep. That was a time when I had to be patient."
