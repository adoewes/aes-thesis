"I∆m going to tell you a time when I was patient. a time I was patient was when I had to save up my money to get the new game halo reach. I had to pre order it with my money, so I did a bunch of work so I cut the lawn at my house then I cut other peoples lawn for two dollars so I did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail. that∆s a time I use patients to wait for something."
