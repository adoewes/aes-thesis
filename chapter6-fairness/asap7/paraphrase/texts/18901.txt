"Being patient is a very important skill to have. You need this to live your life. With out patients your life would be very crazy. One time when I was patient and had to wait for it when it was time it felt good. One day about @NUM1 years ago. I went to @ORGANIZATION1. And if you have been there then you know how long the lines are. They can be up to about a hour and a half. I was waiting for my turn to go on the haunted hause. It looked like it would be a lot of fun. Then when I got there it looked like there were @NUM2 people in line at the time. My mom asked, ô@CAPS1 do you want to go on a different ride and then come back and do the hannah I love?ö I told her no and we got in the line. After about @NUM3 hour in line, there was only about @NUM4 people in front of my mom and and I. Then it was finally our turn when I got to sit down in the chair and be buckled in, it felt good to know that after waiting for a long time I did it , I was patient. I did peeping asking if it was our turn, I just stood there patient. That was the time I realized that I had been patient. I knew from then en that I really could do it, patients. Its an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it being crazy"
