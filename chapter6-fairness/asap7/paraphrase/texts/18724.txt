"ôso @CAPS1 do you want for your @DATE1?ö ôA @NUM1ö ô@CAPS1 else do you want?ö A @NUM1ö I have been wanting a play station @NUM3 for so long. ItÆs my thirteenth @DATE1 and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted oneà I wanted one really dad. The only exception was that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party, all together it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I donÆt want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. ôhey mom when are we having the family party?ö ô@DATE2.ö @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isnÆt patient then I dont know @CAPS1. From this day on I still havent gotten my @NUM1 but two days from now IÆll be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: @CAPS3 I had to wait any longer I probably wouldnÆt have made it. Im not very patient."
