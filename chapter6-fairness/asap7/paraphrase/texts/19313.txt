"ô@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2!ö I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. ô@CAPS5 down, @PERSON1,ö my @CAPS2 told me. ôIÆm comingö, she said. IÆm not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. ItÆs also nice to just take a @DATE1 off and @CAPS1 up to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive isnÆt that short. My @CAPS2 had just finished giving the man our tickets. ô@CAPS6 your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4,ö he told us. ô@CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?ö my @CAPS2 asked me. ô@CAPS10 about the @CAPS11?ö I asked my @CAPS2 ô@CAPS12 not?ö she replied. By the way if you didnÆt know my name is @PERSON1. But thatÆs not important right now. WhatÆs important is getting on the @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the @CAPS11 isnÆt the biggest ride, but itÆs still pretty big. The @CAPS4 is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The @CAPS11 ended up being a blast! After the @CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, The mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 and the @CAPS22. ô@CAPS23 right @PERSON1, pick the last ride,ö my @CAPS2 said @CAPS24 that was easy. We still hadnÆt gone on my favorite ride yet. ô@CAPS25Æs go on the @CAPS26 force,ö I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. @CAPS24,  IÆve been on the ride, and itÆs definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldnÆt be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and IÆm glad I waited for the best ride."
