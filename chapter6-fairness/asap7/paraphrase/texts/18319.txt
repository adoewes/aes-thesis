"ôitÆs where?ö  The woman asked for the third time. ô@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,ö I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didnÆt say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often donÆt meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  ô@CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.ö  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of youngÆs incorporated.  ô@CAPS3, youÆre with youngÆs?ö  @CAPS4 asked. ô  Do you know where the show room is?ö  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  ô@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.ö  I said in a robotic voice.  ô@CAPS6Æt  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?ö  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  ô@CAPS8, sir.ö  ô@CAPS9 old are you?ö  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  ô@CAPS11, sir.ö I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high ûschooler,  so I knew @CAPS4Æd  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. ôAre you getting paid?ö  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  ôyes,  sir.  But itÆs @CAPS12 a lot.  ItÆs more like volunteer work,  really.ö  @CAPS13 donÆt ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  ôthanks son.ö ôYouÆre welcome.ö  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think weÆll both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dadÆs shop, because if @CAPS4 didnÆt, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient."
