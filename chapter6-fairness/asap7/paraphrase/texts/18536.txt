"When I was @NUM1 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking my @CAPS3 ôcan we go to get pizza?ö @CAPS1 every time I asked she would reply, ôif you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizzaö. I didnÆt want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. @CAPS1 I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3. ô@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?ö I asked. ôWere done with the house @CAPS1 the car has yet to be washedö she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, @NUM3.m it said. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet, ôAre you done?ö I asked rudely. ôYou could help if you want it to fasterö @CAPS3 answers. ô@CAPS4, fine IÆll helpö, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, @CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, ôlets do!ö @CAPS5 the whole day I waitd @NUM6 hours for my @CAPS3 and sister to finish @CAPS1 in the end I finished the job."
