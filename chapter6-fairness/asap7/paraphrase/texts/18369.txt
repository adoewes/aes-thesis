"Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn∆t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn∆t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I∆m still alive, right? My friends don∆t know me to have patience and I don∆t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever."
