"You @MONTH1 have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don∆t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 short time before you get @CAPS1 angry. I believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots I related life to sports, because I am a @CAPS1 good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you∆re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, Ù@CAPS2, don∆t do it again.ˆ @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don∆t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have."
