"Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldnÆt sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais, ôhi!ö very excitedly. Now am glad that I stayed patient."
