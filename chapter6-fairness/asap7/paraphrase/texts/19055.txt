Patience is an important part of life and i learned that @DATE1 during hunting season. Most of the @DATE1 we sat and sot saw everything but deer. We were geting to the point where we didn∆t want to go anymore but we did anyways. As  the is days went by as it get colder we started to see some does . My step dad @PERSON1 said we will shoot one on the @DATE2 if we dont see bucks. After a few days it was the @DATE2 and we were going to shoot a doe but we didnt see anything most of the @DATE2. When there was about @NUM1 minutes left of @DATE2 light the perfect buck walked into the field.
