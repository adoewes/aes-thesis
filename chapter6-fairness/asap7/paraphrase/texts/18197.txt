"There was this guy that I liked a lot that I finally had the courage to ask out after @NUM1 years and @NUM2 ? weeks. He said yes to go to the dance with me but no to going out. So a little while later like a week later I asked him again. He told me give him till the end of the week. So I waited and waited and on and on it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn∆t take it she asked him on @DATE1 and he said yes! A million yes, joy came from his mouth. Then @DATE2, after getting to know me better he broke up with me. We have been fighting ever since, but were still besties!"
