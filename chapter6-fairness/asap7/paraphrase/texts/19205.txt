"Are you a patient person? Well I∆m not! Well, I can be patient I just won∆t like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since they∆re kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. it∆s hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didn∆t want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is."
