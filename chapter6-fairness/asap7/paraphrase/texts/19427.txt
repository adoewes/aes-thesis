"RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here!  It took lots of my patience  to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  @ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  @CAPS4 I didn∆t care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named @PERSON1  told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they weren∆t bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now we∆re at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder  I  already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself Ùbe patient.ˆ @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he  just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most."
