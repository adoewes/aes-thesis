"I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1Æs gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said ô@CAPS6Ære leaking trannie fluid.ö @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). ô@CAPS7 is going to ruein our tripö I said to @CAPS2, ô@CAPS6 donÆt know that for sureö he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didnÆt help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 werenÆt sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said ôwere going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car."
