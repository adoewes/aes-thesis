They waited and waited for an hour and it was finally their turn, during this time for man that was in charge of the ferris wheel had watched @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 wait in line. As @PERSON1 were about to step in the cast to mean boys pushed them off to the ground and took their seat. Now mama taught them how to be nice to everyone and they remembered that so they got back up and let them go. When it was their turn again the man in charge of the ferris wheel took notice of what just happened and told them that he was proud of @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 and that they would go around the ferris wheel thrice more for their patients. After the ride, they thanked the man and ran happily home to tell their mom what happened their mama was so proud of them and hug @PERSON1 and @PERSON1."
