"When my @CAPS2 and I got into the checkout line at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient groans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didnÆt seem to notice. ô@CAPS2 this is going to take forever!ö I whined. ô@CAPS3Æt be so negative. ItÆs not that long.ö @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. ô@CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game?ö @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, ô@CAPS7, when youÆre patient, you get food!ö @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home."
