"Everyone has been patient at one time of their. I know I have. A year my brother and I had a projet to do. That we both needed a computer to finish. I let my brother go first. Being that there is one computer in the house I have to wait. After hours I checked to see if my brother was close to being done. He was not, but I had remembered at that moment that he was a slow typer. He finished the next day. In had no problem with it because I had lots of time to type my paper. This is the time I was patient."
