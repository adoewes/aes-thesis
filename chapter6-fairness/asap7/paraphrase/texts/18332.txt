"I remember a time when @CAPS3 sister used to go on and on about @CAPS4 cream sundaes and all that. @CAPS3 mom had to drive me around all day because @CAPS3 dad was sick so that meant the ô@CAPS4 cream girlö had to come along too! @CAPS3 mom knew @CAPS6 was in for a long day. @CAPS5 were in the car and @CAPS5 drove past a @ORGANIZATION1 and thatÆs when @CAPS3 little sister decided out loud ôIÆm hungry I want @CAPS1!!!.ö That is what @CAPS6 said yelling for five minutes straight. ThatÆs when @CAPS3 mom yelled ôyou speak another about @CAPS4 cream you are @CAPS2 getting it!.ö @CAPS3 sister then had this face that meant @CAPS6 was about to cry, which was even worse!!! @CAPS3 mom gave her a cookie so @CAPS6 would stay content for a while; @CAPS5 started driving home when @CAPS5 heard a song on the radio, @CAPS3 sister loves to put the word ô@CAPS4 creamö in every song so @CAPS6 started squirming while holding her tounge. @CAPS6 stayed that way all afternoon. @CAPS6 didnÆt speak a word that entire day! So @CAPS5 drove past @ORGANIZATION1 and then @CAPS6 started to cry. @CAPS6 had enough. ôI want @CAPS4 cream!!.ö @CAPS5 were messing with her, so @CAPS5 went back to @ORGANIZATION1 and got her the thing @CAPS6 wanted most her  ô@CAPS4 cream.ö @CAPS6 was patient the entire day, @CAPS6 knew it was hard work. @CAPS3 little sister learned an important lesson that day, that ôBeing patient means good things will come to you."
