We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. It is a terrifying thirteen hour. We started loding to a van with are soutcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the @DATE1. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe.  I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. As we're just leaving I start pluging in all the wire and game controlles. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. We started seing mountains. They were wonderful. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the???movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient."
