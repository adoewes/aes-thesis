"Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if it∆s a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn∆t believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad∆s dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, Ùwill you use it?ˆ"
