Patience you are under standing and tolerance experaners differ allys with out complaining. I will tell you about a time wen I was patient. ôI gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wallö @CAPS1 you donÆt bye me thisö @CAPS2 yelled. That is an exsampel of black mail one of the many things you have to be patient with in your life. @CAPS2 is a six year old girl that I baby sit.one day she was at my house we wer playing a game that involved kiking a showe into a wall. Wen it was my turn I kiked the shou into the wall literally. My mom came home and I told the boys did that of corse she bileved me. But the one thing I had to do with was that thair was a witness. The six year old that cant keep a secret. I told he not to tell my mom because @CAPS1 she did I would get in big troble and she would not be abel to come over any more. We went to the store and she discovered the glory of black mail she said she would tell my mom @CAPS1 I didnÆt buy her icecreem. I a @NUM1? F day. I refused to  buy her ice creem so she told my mom my mom didnÆt care.
