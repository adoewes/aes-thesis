"One time when I was patient my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1 am. @CAPS2 were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When @CAPS2 got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirpping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When @CAPS2 both walked hardly anybody was there but @CAPS2 went to a store called???, it was so full of people  I thought I was at a concert. @CAPS2 had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So @CAPS2 both waited and waited.  Finally @CAPS2 were at the front of the line and the casher said ô@CAPS1, you have waited in the long line probably for about @NUM2 hour. I will give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.ö @CAPS2 went shopping and @CAPS2 got rewarded for being patient."
