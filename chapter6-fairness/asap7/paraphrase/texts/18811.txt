"One time I had to be patient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my mom, dad, @CAPS1 my sister and my grandma. My cousins live in @LOCATION1 so we were going to visit them. We had to drive @NUM1 hours in a small col bolt with five people. We had to be patient on the car ride there because we were all really exited. When I first found out that we were going I was really happy and I knew I would have to be very patient. We had to drive the hole day then get a motel to stay in. Then we had to drive till about @TIME1 and we were fanaly @TIME1 my great aunts lake house, my my grandmas sister. It was so fun geting to see them again! But then came more patients on the trip home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home everyone of us was tired and tired of being in the car but we were glad we didn∆t have to drive anothe hour home like my grandma. That was a time when I had to be patient."
