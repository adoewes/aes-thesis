"One day my mom, my sister, and I was going to the hair salon to get our hair done. It was so many people there talking. It was kind of noisy too. The tv was on, the radio was on, and a bunch of people talking. When we got there my mother signed all three of us in on the sign in sheet then we had to sit and wait. We waited for a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day but my mom said we had to wait. I got hungry and I was sleepy. We waited for an hour. I didn∆t let it bother me, so I turned on my @NUM1 player and listened to it until it was time for us to come next. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even more hungry but I didn∆t say anything. So we waited and waited and finally we were up next. And we all got our hair done. Then when we left we went to get some food because we were all hungry. And that was a time I was patient at hair salon."
