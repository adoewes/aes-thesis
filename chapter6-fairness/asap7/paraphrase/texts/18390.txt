"In this story I am wating a hut the time when the video game @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was coming at for @CAPS3 @NUM1. The game will be the last game for the comcay bunsie. I∆ve already have it and he caming. I pretty good, but I don∆t understand why your mom character stays on a plant called @CAPS2 and is the only comsnap there, and of the entire gone character gets bum-rushed by coughly @NUM2 aliens with swords and they chep up your character it to bue size pieces with there little toy plastic swords. And the first time I went to buy the ones at @CAPS5 @CAPS6 at @NUM3 there parking lot was filled with probally all @NUM4 year olds who live in their mom∆s basement. So we waited and got it about @NUM5 week after its me let cetense. We bought it then we get morecor and it wasn∆t the fight gave it was some week @PERSON1 game so catemed it in like two minutes so that is no stay on being patient."
