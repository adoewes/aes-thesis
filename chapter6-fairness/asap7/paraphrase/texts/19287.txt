"Patient I was patient when I was in @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 appointment to wait in the waiting room. My some teacher says wait a minit because teachers are talking to someone else. When I have any @CAPS3 teacher says don't open it so I always been patient. When someone tells me to wait. I also be patient when I'm waiting for the buses, airplanes, trains to come. I be patient when I'm bored to wait sometimes. That's how I've been patient."
