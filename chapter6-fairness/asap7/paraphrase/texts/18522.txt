"The time I waited for party to happen. It was @DATE2 until I∆ve been invited to a party at zapzone. He told me the party was on @DATE1. @NUM1 weeks he told me that, and still didn∆t have the party the he told that I had pay for myself accepted. But it was a party so I didn∆t have @NUM2 weeks later I went school shopping for ten minutes. I came back he said he already had a party. He wasn∆t there because a party takes an hour or two so I just let it go."
