"Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told youˆ@CAPS1 be patient? Recently @CAPS2 been patient. My family got a new microwave and its too big for our counter so we had to put it above our stove. Well there wasn∆t enough space above the stove so my parents decided to remadle the whole kitchen. My step mom took everything out of the kichen and put it all over dinning room, and now we can barely walk in the dinning room .Lately my family has been eating in our living room. (@CAPS3) I really don∆t like eating in our living room it @CAPS1 seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So that∆s a good thing. Idon∆t know how much longer I can keep up with this. But @CAPS2 @CAPS1 got to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off. Now you know to always be patient."
