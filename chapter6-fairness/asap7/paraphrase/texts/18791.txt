"To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousin∆s house to watch her daughter @CAPS1∆ @PERSON1 , for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldn∆t wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldn∆t hush. Tthen I said, Ù @NUM1 , what∆s the matter ?ˆ @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because  I stayed somewhat calm and I didn∆t complain to @CAPS1∆@CAPS4∆s mom."
