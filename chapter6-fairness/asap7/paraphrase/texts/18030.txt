"I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months ûold baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when ôher baby,ö @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it."
