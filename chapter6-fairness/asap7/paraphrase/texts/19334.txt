"To me,  patient is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. ôDo you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?ö I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. ô@CAPS2 buddy we just ran out.ö @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess IÆll have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didnÆt grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort."
