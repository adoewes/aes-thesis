"Someone l know that is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people l know. Especially on this certain day. Every once and a while my brothers and sister and l are just kind of hard to handle. We where on our way to church when my brother and l started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brothe and my sister where frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at meà she pinched me. Then we finally got to church l guess my mom figure it would stop once we got there, but no my three year old brother @PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends. I know l would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why l think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave."
