It was late @DATE1  when my @CAPS1 is and I was going to @CAPS2 point for my @CAPS1. So we take forever  to drive  there just sitting in the back sent all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally get there wasting all my patients on being in the car after we get in we go on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5 wait to ride a @NUM1 minute ride it is worth it but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I m waiting then we get off the ride they we go on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there  were at least 1-@NUM1 hours long. Except one ride the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowd  came in. So it was on leg @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on the ride and at the top of the  hill it was probably a @CAPS5 line. So we really lucked out on that one. But @CAPS8 the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and that was all the patients left so we were in line to leave the park  for another @CAPS5 and a half so we waited and waited and finaly it moved and once we got through the park and out of it the road we had to take was  closed because of a car accident so we had to talk this huge detoer  that added a @CAPS5 to our time  because of traffic taking that way and @CAPS8 the time we got to our hotel I didn∆t have one drop of  patients left I felt like I was going to blow up but I didn∆t I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patients.
