"I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady havent called my name yet, after waiting like @NUM1 minutes. I just turned my @NUM2 player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine.  Before I knew it @CAPS2 called my name, ô@CAPS1ö @CAPS2 said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going on I thought to myself ômaybe being patient isnÆt that bad after all!ö"
