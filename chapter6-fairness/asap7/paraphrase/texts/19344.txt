"A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my gymnastics meet to start. I had to wait two hours along with my team. We warmed up and stretched and were talking about who we thought would win the team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour. So, we talked some more and practiced some skills for floor. We dida head-stand contest and did as much as we could to make the time go by. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be a half hour longer because they had to get another judge. Finally an hour later the judge got their and the coaches had their meeting and we stan?? The meet. That is a time I was patient."
