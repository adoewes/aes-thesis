"A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didn∆t understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didn∆t go with science, and he didn∆t listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldn∆t beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient."
