"One time I was patient was when I was going to @LOCATION1 because the car ride was @NUM1 hours long. I was hungery, bored, and really needed to use the bathroom. I didn∆t tell nobody because I knew we could not stop. I looked out the window but got bored. We were going to @LOCATION3, I was happy we stop and eat in @LOCATION3, I know that from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION3 is not a long way but hey I eat at @NUM2 and is like noon. We finally eat like having and hour in @LOCATION3. I did really good being paitent, because when I am unpaitent I get really mood and people don∆t want to be with me when I∆m mood."
