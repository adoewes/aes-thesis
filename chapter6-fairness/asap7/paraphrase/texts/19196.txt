"A time that I had to be patient was at cedar point in @LOCATION1. My @CAPS1, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at cedar point. My @CAPS1Æs stayed at the motorhome while my @CAPS1, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but @NUM1 or @NUM2 of the roller coasters, my @CAPS1 by the way, am not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my @CAPS1 were going to back to the moterhome, but I wanted to go on just on??? before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my @CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever. I have @CAPS2, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still, I had to try very hard but eventraully I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride by the way was extremely amazing."
