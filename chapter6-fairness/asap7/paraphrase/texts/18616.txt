"Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear ô@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2.ö so I got up and checked it @NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from at @NUM2 all from @CAPS6 dad. I felt something was wrong. I called him back and I hearö @CAPS1 get ready grandm @CAPS4 I coming to get you. ôI said it`s @NUM3 @CAPS5 are you nuts?ö at this time I was at a family members house @CAPS8 @CAPS6 dad said ô@PERSON2 was in a bad crush.ö @CAPS6 heart drop and I started crying.ö get your stuff together and I will call you back with more info.ö I got off phone @CAPS6 aunt was up she came into the room I told her what I knew. I was getting @CAPS6 stuff together try not ta wake anyone else up. When I was waiting for the call everything went through @CAPS6 mind. I was with him, what happened, is be ok is he going to die? @CAPS8 I heard beep beep I said good bye and ran out. Running made me think of more like: how bad is he hurt, what was he driving, what was he doing out? I got in the car I questioned @CAPS6 grandma asking her where is mom, where is @LOCATION1, where is @CAPS7 are they ok: when will I see him? All I knew in had to be patience. @CAPS8 I got the call I asked @CAPS6 dad ôwhat happen what did he hit, who called @NUM4, where do we go?ö the first thing that came out of @CAPS6 dads mouth wasö calm down I can`t come home but @PERSON1 will be there I want you to stay with him okö yes dad I will and dadö I saidö youö he said back. I said æI love you.ö ôI love you tooö he said. The worst time for @CAPS6 life was waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were @CAPS6 dads when @CAPS6 dad wasn`t home. I know I would be fine with @PERSON1. How will be act seeing his bestfriend like that? @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are fire men I wonder if they knew who helped @PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hand to do but I had to be patience. I remember closing @CAPS6 eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I get to go in @PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem all the glass on him @CAPS8 dayna said look who is here he opened his eyes they got really big when seen me.ö @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said @PERSON1 come here ô@PERSON1 went. @PERSON2 said æthank you for taking care of @CAPS6 little sister I love you man.ö That is the time in @CAPS6 life I had to be patience to see @CAPS6 brother. I didnÆt care how he looked as long as he is ok."
