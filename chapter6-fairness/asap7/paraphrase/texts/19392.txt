My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.
