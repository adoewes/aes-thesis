"Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? IÆm going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctorÆs office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, thatÆs why. The morning probably wasnÆt really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctorÆs office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said ôI have an appointment for my son.ö And the lady at the front window said ôthe @NUM1 appointment?ÆÆ ô@CAPS1 thatÆs the oneö said my dad .ö ôYour son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccinedö @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me ôyou know what? YouÆre a patient patient!ö I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasnÆt so patient , it mightÆve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day."
