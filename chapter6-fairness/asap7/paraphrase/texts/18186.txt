"Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I don∆t also ??? Well I am going to tell you about a time when I was inpatient and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get in the bus stop @NUM1 min early, so I can talk with my mother ??? Try I got up to early. I made it to the bus stop early. ??? @NUM2 min later I decided to go back home. By the time I got home I was going to be late. I hurried at the door, but I was too late, the bus was gone. I should have more patient. On day I was going to burger ??? was to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. When I got their, their where about @NUM3 peace in their, so I decided to wait my turn in line like I had later. I was there people payed from cash regester. I was finally their I ordered my burger when I was done it was worth the wait. In conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. Sports, school or home and even in public, I hope my story made you relise how important it is to be patient."
