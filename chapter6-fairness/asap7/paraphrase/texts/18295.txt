One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line. We where mad and my dad was losing his patients too. We wait for hours till it was finally our turn. We wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time l lost my patients.
