There was a day when I was super ???. I did everything slow I got redy for ??? slow I walked slow I talked slow. My mom was very patient with me all she did was incorege me to move faster she tried to motiveit me and help me get redy for school she brought me my breakfast and put all my books into my back back. I thanked her all the end of the day for being so patient with me. That was the day someone was patient with me.
