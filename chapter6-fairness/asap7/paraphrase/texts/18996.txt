"I do not have the much patience because this year IÆm getting a laptop every day I look up one I have I cant down I my iPod, I keep talking to my family about it I do not go a senond without thinking about my laptop I have everything ready for one but I have to wait. Waiting for a laptop is not the only thing I had to have patience for. Last year for @CAPS1 I got an iPod favor but I had to wait till @CAPS1 eve because my family pitched in we bought it on black @DATE1 so I looked at youtube vidoes on iPod touchs because I could not wait any longer. It is hard to have patience when you want something when you already have it."
