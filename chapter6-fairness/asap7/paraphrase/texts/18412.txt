"I am not a very patient person. But when I have to be I am. For example at my house we only have one bathroom. I hate waiting to go. But I have to wait because I don∆t want to jungle pee so I will wait. I also have to wait for my bust. I hate waiting its so boring. But patience is a good thing to have.  If we didn∆t there would be a lot of deaths by car accidents, murders, nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient she can wait in one spot for hours one time it was @CAPS1 I was all figtxy from waiting until the bell rang so we can go trick or treating. She waited well she did her hair I complained that is a reason why patience is important."
