"A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient."
