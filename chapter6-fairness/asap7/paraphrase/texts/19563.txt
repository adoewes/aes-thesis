"A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot!"
