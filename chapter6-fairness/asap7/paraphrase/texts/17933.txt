"ô@CAPS1 story of patientö One time I was patient was when I went to the @CAPS2 for a check-up. Me and @CAPS1 dad have wait in the lobby for ?? time, after every ?? went in for the appointments. I couldnÆt take it no more, but he made me stay. So I kept quiet. Well, most of the time really I wanted to say something really bad but instead I held it in. So finally we went in I was so happy. It was like I was the happiest man on earth. ThatÆs @CAPS1 story about patience."
