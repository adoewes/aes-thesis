"It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME3. The sun was just coming up as I got into my box blind. It had snowed the @TIME1 but it was only @DATE1. Then again I was in the upper penisaala of @LOCATION1. I was hunting for a monster ten point with my brand new @NUM1 and @TIME2 gun could kill a dear @NUM2 yards. I have been sitting for an hour but it felt like a day. IÆve only seen a squarile and he was fun to watch in all but not the rush you get when you see a deer. ô@CAPS1, @CAPS1!ö I was looking in the direction the sound was coming. ô@CAPS1, @CAPS1!ö gun up @TIME2 time my adrenilen hicking in. ô@CAPS1, @CAPS1!ö I see move ment put my scope on it and I see it. ItÆs a itÆs a grouse? I glowered the gun calmed down and watched it eat some corn. It was @NUM3. time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwhich, a apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture @TIME2 a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big @NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old. I put my crosshairs just be hind the shoulder and I diehed the safety off. Slowly pulled the trigger. My mind a blur and ô@CAPS4!ö perfect shot. Later @TIME2 I found him and he was big @NUM5. I got him mounted and thatÆs were he is now."
