Patience is when you wait for something with out complaining. A time I was patient is when I was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient si icould go into a ride in @LOCATION1 adventures. It was shimbering timbers. The line was very and when I mean very I mean long. It took me about a half of hour to get on ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that one was shorter. It only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these  rides have to show patiene because if I didn∆t show patience I wouldn∆t be riding the good rides. The last one is when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the thunder hawk and the line took like for a whole hour. I played my nintendo as while I was waiting so it could be patient. An hour later I got to ride that ride all because of patience.
