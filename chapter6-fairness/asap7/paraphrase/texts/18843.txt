"Being patient isnÆt always that easy, in fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with @NUM1 rude, screaming and crying kids for @NUM2 hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great @CAPS3 davn in???. with my grandpa. My @CAPS1 pa is fan bag to talk to, @CAPS2 later than I found out my @NUM1 younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my ipod and a book, @CAPS2 my cousins brought??? loud noisy and flossy toys they bot just for the ride. As we started heading for @LOCATION1 I turned my ipod on and found out it only had @PERCENT1 battery left. Half way there I was almost dad of borden, @CAPS2 the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep I decided to join them. WACK! I auske is a sobbery slap to the face, ôwere hereö my cousin enchoired, finally I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore, and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my @CAPS3, it was about @NUM4 hrs and my cousins were all asleep again and I knew it was going to be a nice ride home."
