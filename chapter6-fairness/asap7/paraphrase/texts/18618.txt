"It was bright sunny day, and I was playing with my play doe. Finally I finished making my tower it took a hour fixing. I started at it in amazement. I was proud very proud at myself. I got out a piece of play doe and I made it into the ô@CAPS1ö IÆ put it on the top of the tower. Well my five minutes of amazement was near its end @CAPS2! I look up to see that my tower was ruined . I look infront of me and see my neiber I told him why did he do that he said because it`s fun. I told him it`s fun for you but not for me. It took me an hour to finish it it`s a good thing I was patient. He looked down and said @CAPS3 sorry for what I did. I told him it all right, how about if we build it again but even better. He agreed and we both set to work. See how patience is important the problem could have become bigger. The end."
