In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don∆t rush because you can mess up. Don∆t go way to slow because then people will think you don∆t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don∆t have patience aren∆t always happy all the time.
