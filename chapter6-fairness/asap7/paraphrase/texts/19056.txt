One day me my mom and my brother were driving in our car. We were going to a beach when sudnly our car wouldnt move. The battery had been run down and didnt work. My mom called a tow truck and said he wouldnt be here for two hours! Me and my brother complained all the time but my mom just sat quiet so whe the truck (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3) got to us ua ome. I was amazed by my moms patience.
