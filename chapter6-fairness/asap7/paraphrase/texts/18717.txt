"Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can∆t stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. I∆m around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen."
