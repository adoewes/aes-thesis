"One stormy day, me and my brother were playing soccer in our house. My brother kicked the ball in the air and did a scissors kick. The ball hit my mom∆s lamp and broke the bulb. She asked me and I said that it was my brother. My mom said that I should fix the lamp. It was hard and the pieces kept falling off. It took mere patience to fix it. Finnaly, no managed to fix it. Patience is always good to be patient."
