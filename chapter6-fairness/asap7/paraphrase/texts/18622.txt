"This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every @NUM1 months. Me, my brothers and my sister and it takes about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. When the doctor ask my brothers questions when he says then I am already coming up with my answer and then its my turn, but before my turn @NUM4 sce the doctor I was ireally patient. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. Then he has to talk to my mom that comes my time with lls. When we do to the doctor or dentist we and really patient but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do."
