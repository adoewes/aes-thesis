"A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn∆t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins won∆t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn∆t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don∆t think that I∆ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, ÙPatience is a virtue.ˆ"
