"When I went deer hunting with my dad I was patient. When me and my dad went deer hunting I had to be patint by waiting. The hardest part was being quiet to. I also had to stay still. Being patint is waiting for some thing. I had to be patint because I was waiting for a deer all day. Even now I did not get a deer, I was quiet, still and patint."
