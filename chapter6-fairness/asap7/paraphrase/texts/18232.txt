"Patients is everything, ever hear these words! When you waiting in line for a test food restaurant, or when you stuck in a traffic. YouÆre annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. ôpatient is everything,ö one time I was waiting in the longer line ever waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could we the counter I saw the empeloyees rushing around trying tralicly to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason of the holdap. There was an old man at the front of the line trying to despreately order. I didnÆt blame him, wich all those choices, he didnÆt know what to pick, the lost of the line wasnÆt as patient, ôharry up.ö One said ôcome on.ö @CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line wasnÆt really being fair. I suggested a choice for him and he ordered. Sure, I way @NUM1 minutes late for my class but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, what comes around goes around they say, rest of the day I felt good about my good deed"
