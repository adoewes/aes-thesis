"I chose write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting, I was only hunting squirls but still. What I had to was walk in the woods and sit down once you sit down you cant move. So I was sitting very still for @NUM1 minutes and finally I seen a squirl. So I took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirl. So that∆s my story on patients."
