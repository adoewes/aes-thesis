"ôPatience is a virtue.ö I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. ôpatience is virtue, patience is a virtue.ö I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. SheÆs an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I donÆt love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, IÆve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasnÆt too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didnÆt have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. ô@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.ö @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didnÆt want poop all over the house. ôI know, but I canÆtö ôwell why canÆt you?ö ô@CAPS1 I donÆt want to.ö I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying ôpatcience is a virtue.ö I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. ô@PERSON4 IÆll bet you canÆt go get them as fast as a cheetah!ö ô@CAPS2 I can!ö ô@CAPS3, prove it.ö @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you."
