"Being patient means waiting, when one of my brothers was patience. We were there for six hours just to bail out my brother, we had to go to four different prisons to take my brother out. I was scared but I knew ther if I was patient everything would come out good. So we were waiting we had to bail him at before @NUM1 o∆clock. We were theire since @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My mom was very nervous. I told her many time to calm down everything was going to be alright. So he and my cousin went in we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren∆t bailing out at that time that maybe around @NUM3. So we went to get something to eat. We went again and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was @NUM4 o clock. They gave us something we had to cook. We went to @NUM1 different stores and they said we couldn∆t cash it. So we went to the chase bank and we cashed it and we took out my brother."
