"I had to be patience many times. I had to be patience when my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patience. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room.  It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they were very good at there job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert.  I was so nervous and the neeves kept growing. I waited for @NUM5 min but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I song my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be @NUM7. I am not good at being patience, but I waited and got good results."
