"It was @DATE1 when   my family and I went to cedar point. It was really exciting and fun. The trip was about three or six hours long. I went to sleep but when I wake up we was at burger king.  I ordered we a kids meal and it was good. so  as  we  got  back  in the  car I stayed up the  rest  of  the way there.  Then I start seeing water parks and hotels it was really nice. Then I seen this really tall roller coaster   I got really excited that I ran to the line, bed they were all long. I had a wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was my tom in like  I was so  happy and  excited   that  when I got  my   stamp  I ran  to the @CAPS1-@CAPS2  in  door  roller  coaster. So I had to  wait  an hour  in line , so I got  really tired, but I kept mouing  forward, when I reached the  stairs  finally I got  on the  ride. I was binda scared at the sometime because it was dark. then  we  took off then it  got  off I was  dissy, but I went  on another  ride  and  got  disser. I got on this ride that rocks side to side. His is the time I was patient."
