"One time I was patient when @PERSON1 @CAPS1 would not work every body sat down and was quet. It took up the hole hour there was a little, chitt chatt her and there but mostly every body was quiet for her while a capo of sudents helped her. We going to watch a movie about @NUM1 themes of @CAPS2, but when she tryed to play the movie, it wouldn∆t come on you could hear it but couldn∆t see it, the at the end of the hour you could see it but you couldn∆t hear it, Ùbut it worked for all the other the classesˆ @PERSON1 said the next day she gave us fruits snacks for being so patient and she got the movie to work first it was in just gray and white the she jiggled a card then it showed color but the day that I was patient was the @NUM2 time. I was patient with a teacher she was proud of me and I was proud of myself I can∆t believe what I did for @PERSON1 then it happend again this time she let every body just chill in our chair and talk with our friend but I just watten her fix her @CAPS1 but the next day she didn∆t give us a treat because our treat was just chilling in our chairs and talking with our friends∆. That was a time when my classmates and I were patient."
