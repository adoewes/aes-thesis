"Here is a way that I had to be patient, and we all know that??? has to be patient with others. ??? Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn∆t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn∆t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn∆t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time."
