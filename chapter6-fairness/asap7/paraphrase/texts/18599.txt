"I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient."
