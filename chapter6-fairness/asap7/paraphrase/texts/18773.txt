"Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. @CAPS1∆s a good one to have too, @CAPS1 can help you in a lot of situations. If gas have patience, you wont get nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend @PERSON1 was getting me. I didn∆t think about @CAPS1 that much so @CAPS1 didn∆t really get to me. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. I was still able to keep @CAPS1 off my mind. I had to make sure I didn∆t think about @CAPS1, so I wouldn∆t beg my friend to know what @CAPS1 was, because that would be impatient. If your impatient people might get annoyed because you will always ask questions, and got on there nerves. @CAPS1∆s good to be patient with friendhips, so you dont become mean to them or anyone else. @CAPS1∆s @CAPS2 not good to be impatient with your family. If your patient you can work things out better, and stay more on task and focused."
