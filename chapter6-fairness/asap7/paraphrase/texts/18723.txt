"A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient.  I waited in the waiting  soon for about fifteen minutes, then the assistant called  me in. first  she told me what she going to do,  second she  took a x-ray of my teeth , third she put metal bonds with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth, fourth @PERSON1 put the brackets on with really strong glue. Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal hands, finally, she asked me what color I wanted then she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience it was hard but I did it. That is the time I had patience."
