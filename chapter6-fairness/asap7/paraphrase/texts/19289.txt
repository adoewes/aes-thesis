"I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patient. I had to use patients when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box @NUM1. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. Alls I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patients because if I didn∆t I would have been really bored. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it. I t took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patients so the system could be delivered. Patients is a very needy thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patients."
