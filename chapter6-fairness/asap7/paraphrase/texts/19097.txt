My story in own way about being patience is when there is like @NUM1 people in front of a line a ceter point. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don∆t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don∆t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don∆t get the secrety on you.
