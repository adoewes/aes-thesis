"It was one @DATE1 morning in wisconson last day of deer hunting. I got up and dressed me my dad and friend where all sitting down to eat we had pankacs and milk. Out side it was about @NUM1 so we buttered up and  and headed at. I was kind of scary in the worst at night because we don't know whats out there or whos out there. but after we got in. He stand all my ways went away. After @NUM2 hours in the stand my dad tells me ""@CAPS1 time to get back and eat"" not right now"" l said ""@CAPS1"" said my dad then l guess I'll see you latter so after he came back it wa right around @NUM3 when out of the bruch came the buck l was wating for. So l bought my gun up and shot he went right down. I have never been  so proud in my life The @CAPS3."
