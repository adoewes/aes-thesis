"Havening a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know some one who doesˆ well that∆s exacually what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always woundered about her there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldn∆t wait but you know what she had patience. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasn∆t like other children, couldn∆t wait and always bother her parents she just sat patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2∆s too. She couldn∆t wait to leave but you know what got her, patience in the store and get that pacific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted it was just lips glass five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home she was so tired and she wen∆t up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait, that∆s how accedents and problems happen and this little girl got every thing she wanted one thing, she had patience."
