One day when I went to the doctors to get shots my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying Ê∆do we really have to go∆∆ of  course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit my mom had to get the papers so I just standed there and watched the fish swim around then my mom said Ê∆lets go in the waiting room∆∆. After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally get in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions the the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm she said you are like almost the only one of are kid patients that has it been patient. And that is the story of when I was patient.
