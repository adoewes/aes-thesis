"A  time   when   I  was  patient  was when  I  went  to  the  doctors. When  I  went  to  the  doctors  for  a  checkup, my  appointment  was  at  @TIME1 and  we  didn∆t  get  called  till @NUM1.  I had to wait a long time! Finally  when  we  got into the  doctors room  the  nurse  did my blood pressure and then  I  had  to  wait  another  @NUM2 mins  for  the  actuall  doctor. By the time the doctor   actually came it was about @NUM3.  I  got  my  flue  shot  and  the  swine  flue  shot.  When  I  was  all done  it  was  @NUM4  I was  ready  to  go  home.  That∆s  a  time  when  I  was  patient."
