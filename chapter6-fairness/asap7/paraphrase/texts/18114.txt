When I had to @CAPS1 patient one of my most memorable time when. I had to @CAPS1 patient was  when  I ordered my first cleric guitar  I ordered my guitar of of areputibal guitar website that my guitar teacher @CAPS2 I waited and  I waited tell finially I got my guitar I took it out of the @CAPS3 and it was chipied. I was extremly angry. We sent the guitar @CAPS4 for a new one about @DATE2 I got another guitar a so I though opened it up. It was the same guitar I had sent @CAPS4 I was even more angry. So again we sent the guitar @CAPS4 hoping that we would finally get the wright one. It was @DATE1 and I got my guitar.
