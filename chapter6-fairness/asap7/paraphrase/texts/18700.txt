"Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go a friend's house. Savannah dad is a firefighter and he had to put out of fire a could not pick me up to the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I haven't seen savannah in @NUM1 months. That day I learned Patience is a way of life people have to live with and this is the time I had to live with it."
