A time that I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother in @LOCATION1 and then he kicked me in the chin and I promised him that I would not tell on him even when I busted my chin open the second time he kicked me and I fell to the ground right in front of everybody else and then I was being swarmed like a bunch of bees around a hive full of honey. That was when I was being patient.
