"I can∆t really tell you about a time when I∆ve been patient because that something I struggle with no matter how hard I try to be patient it just seems to be impossible but it∆s not, maybe. I just don∆t try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is I∆m at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I won∆t save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can∆t spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it don∆t want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble. @NUM1 words."
