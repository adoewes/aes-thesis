"One time I was very patient. We were on a train going to @LOCATION1. I didn't have my game or music player. It fit live it would never spend, @CAPS2 I didn't complane.I sat in the seat for what felt like forever. Then when we got off the train I said ""@CAPS1. I'm done.""@CAPS2 then there was the bus ride to the musem of science one histry. Not as in thout to myself. Once agin stop after stop we went. Untill finally we got their. It was amazing, there were tons of interesting things like amiten that made tops or @CAPS3. @CAPS2 then patience are ?? when we went to the history. It was the train allover agin. Dad had to see everything and anything ??? Then we had to take the bus back to the train. Next the trained agin. @CAPS2 this time I had a top by that got boring so I still didn't complain. @CAPS2 dad said it has to long and I would be able to bring my os next time. That is my example of pacience."
