One time I went to cetar point and I was rideing in the car. And we were about @NUM1 hour away from the cetar point park. And I was talking with my sister @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 and I fell asleep. And the we were there I was so excited and that I couldn∆t wait to go on the @CAPS1. And I was walking in the park with sisters mom& dad into the park and all I could hear was people scream on the rollercoaster and the we were in line for the @CAPS1 and I was in the back of the line and I was to unpatience and I was like in my mind com∆on com∆on and I was in like feeling like I didn∆t want to on it anymore and I was time to ride the @CAPS1 and I went on it and I was off the ride in matters of @NUM2 sec. and that was my story of patiences.
