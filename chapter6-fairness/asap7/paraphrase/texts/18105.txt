Have you ever had tot waiting @NUM1 hour line? this is what it was like for me and @CAPS1. We were at ceder point waiting to ride too thrill dragster. We had just got there the first thing we decided to do was ride the top thrill dragseter but the line was about a three hour wait we went anyway.  We had just fineshed our first hour of waiting but it felt like three. I knew I had to be patient and relaxe but it just felt like forever. after anthor hour my stomach started to growl I checked my watch it was @NUM2 we had got here at @NUM3 I was starving and tiered but I stayed finaly an hour later it was our turn when I got off I knew it had been worth it to be patient. In conclusion I learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life.
