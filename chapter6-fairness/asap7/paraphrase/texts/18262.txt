"The time when I showed patient is when I was having to go down a waterslide. It all started when I was in @LOCATION1. I want to go swimming at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. The place was so big, you could fit @NUM1 people in it. The time I was patient is when I was going up the stairs to the slide when every body rush in front of me just to go down @NUM2 slide∆s. So I waited about @NUM3 minutes just to go on fun slide. The blason it took me so long is because you have to walk up @NUM2 flight or stair∆s with in ??? So the second time  I went up I ran up the stair∆s so I could be the first one, so I did and  I still had to wait because it still people there from last time. So I waited my turn. That is the time I showed patient."
