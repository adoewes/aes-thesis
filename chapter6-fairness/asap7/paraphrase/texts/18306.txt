"Patientce is hard for example when you walk in to a @CAPS1Æs office you must patiently wait your turn to see the @CAPS1. Patience is just another word for ôwaitö you have to be wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you patiently wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you ô@CAPS2 wait to see the @CAPS1. Patience is hard for some people. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a @CAPS1. another example is ô@CAPS3ö when familys go on a road trip you here @CAPS3 say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness we, well that is a sign of no patience. Whats so ever so what I would say if someone came up to me and said what is patienceö? I would say ôwaitö wait your turn, ??? for the dos, wait for the @CAPS1, and wait for us to get there."
