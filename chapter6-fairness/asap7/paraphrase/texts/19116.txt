"One day my mom and dad were looking up vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to @LOCATION1 a place just outside traverse city. We decided to go for @NUM1 days it was going to start next month i was excited to go but i still had enough patience to wait and wait till the people called us to tell us that we could go (expecting our reservation) to @LOCATION1. When the day finally came i was really excited. We got everything  packed  and ready to go even the dogs were ready to go. After we put the dogs in we started  to go. We had to have the dogs go to my grandmas because they had no were else to go,so we dropped them of and started heading to @LOCATION1 plus it was four hour drive. When we were about an hour in the drive my sister got really impa tiant and kept asking are we there yet but i just sat there and looked out the window. Then we got to a pitstop and we whent and got our water and drinks. My mom and dad wanted coffee so then tried to get some but it didn∆t work so we had to stay there for like @NUM2 minutes and they finally got some coffee and me and mironda were just sitting there the whole time. Then we were patiant the whole ride to @LOCATION1."
