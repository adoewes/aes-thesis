"A time when I was patient was when me and my cousin family went @LOCATION1 and my sister was sick. Me and my other sister sat on my car. For about two and a half hours. My sister was getting mad but I just sat there patiently. My mom and sister were in the doctors office for the longest time! my sister ended up going to the doctors office three times. But I was very patient, when she wasn∆t at the doctor, all she wanted to do was lay down so we barely gat to do any fun stuff. By the end of the trip she was feeling better so my mom took us to do something fun. That was a time when I was patient."
