"One day I was looking at a catalog in a store, and saw a goalkeeper shirt that I really wanted. So I went to my mom and showed her what I wanted. She said it was a bit pricy, but that she would get it. The next week was very long, waiting for the shirt. On @DATE1 it came, pale yellow, red, blue, and purple. I finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear to games and make great saves."
