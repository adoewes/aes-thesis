One day my family and I all went to @CAPS1 point. I was so excited. When we arrived I rushed out the car. We got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on. We were gonna go on the @CAPS2 dragon there was such a long line. It felt like wasn∆t even moving. I was as patient as can be. I was so excited to try this ride the family finaly moved up bup bup finally!!! We were next. We all got in our seats and made sure we were backled in nice and tight. The roller coaster was about a couple minutes long it was worth the wait. That was the time is was patient.
