"One time that l was patient was when we went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. We had to wait in line for an half an hour. We were supposed to get on the cork screw ride. I was very excited to go on that ride. So I decided to be patient. So for @NUM1 min once we got to the front of the line l couldn't wait. So I hurried up and got on then ride. I really didn't like that day when l had to stand up that long. But, that what patience means."
