"Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, sister, grandma, aunt, uncle my @NUM1 year old niece and baby cusin. When we where done, we went to a restaurant to eat. After @NUM2 minutes of waiting for the waitress, she comes over just to tell us she will be with us ô@CAPS1ö. So we wait for half an hour just to put our drink orders in. When we finally got to order our food it took them an hour to bring it."
