"IÆm constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time IÆm able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked ô@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?ö @CAPS2 responded ôwith patience and years of practice.ö The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom ô@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?ö @CAPS2 replies ô@CAPS4, @CAPS9?ö I answered ô@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice withö. ô@CAPS6.ö @CAPS2 says. When we get there, thereÆre @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didnÆt go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said ô@CAPS8, I know youÆll catch on soon!ö and I wondered out loud ô@CAPS9?,Æ @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper ôbecause any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.ö"
