"One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient."
