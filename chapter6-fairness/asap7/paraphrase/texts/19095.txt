"When I was in the sub line and in @NUM1 grade I waited patiently. If you cut infront of me, I would not care. Than when I waited for @NUM2 minutes and the line was still big. My patience meter went down after @NUM3 minutes I finally got to get a sub. I waited @NUM4 minutes for a sub that is like waiting to get pizza. Once I got to the check-out center I had no money in my account, so I was really angry, angry as in you not being paid any money for a year."
