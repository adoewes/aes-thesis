"This story is how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days. I have been patient by wanting to see what I get for my birthday even though it bugs me really bad! Also IÆve been patient because IÆm having a sleepover with all my close friends. It seems like it is taking for ever. At my sleepover there is going to be cake and ice cream! ô@CAPS1!ö IÆve also been patient because im turning twelve which means I will be patient. Then the day after my sleepover my mom, me and my brother are going to the mall and then to the movies and I get a hundred dollars to speand. At the mall! It is very hard being patient to do fun things. Finally IÆve been patient by not asking everyone if they are coming. Some girls forget to ask their parents and it buss me because there is only two days left. This story showed how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days! But you have to be patient to do fun things I have learned just recently."
