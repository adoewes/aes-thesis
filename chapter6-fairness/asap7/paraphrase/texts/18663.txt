"Hi my name is @PERSON1 and I∆m going to tell you a story about how one time I was patience. I remember when I was patience. It was chismis day. There was tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There was tiny ones all the way to hamuges ones. But I couldn∆t even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I wanted to go into my mom∆s and dad∆s room and wake them up. But no without some brekfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so can open my precidens. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my precidents."
