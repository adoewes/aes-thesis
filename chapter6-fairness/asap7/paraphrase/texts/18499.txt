"Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced of the arm rest with every one movement. I had asked my @CAPS1 to hurry up @CAPS2 I wouldnÆt be late. I had told her like I have a million times before, ô@CAPS1, you know how much being on time for practice means to me.ö @CAPS2 I sat there slummped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens @CAPS7 the time, I thought my @CAPS1 would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunatly, with every flip, I became more irretated. ô@CAPS3 is she? Why is she taking @CAPS2 long?ö @CAPS4 like these swirled in my head. Then, my @CAPS1 came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door crecked open. My @CAPS1 started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed @NUM1, I for sure new that I wasnÆt going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took deep breathes. Taking lots of deep breathes helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. ô@CAPS5 passient.ö I told myself. ô@CAPS5 passient. Relax, youÆll make it there.ö @CAPS7 of a sudden my @CAPS1 slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read @NUM3. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself ôsee you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and @CAPS7 you had to do was slow down and @CAPS5 passient. Great jobö"
