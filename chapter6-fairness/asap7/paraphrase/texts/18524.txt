"A time when I was patient was when I was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 ,@LOCATION2 ,we were waiting in line for this water roller coaster and the line was really long and they had this line called easy pass where you wait an hour ,then go to this machine to get a eazy pass ticket but we decided to wait in the really, long line .So half an hour later went by and I started to get really board so I asked my dad if he wanted to play this game called slapps .So we played for a little while went past and we were about half way there and we started regreting stay in the huge line because it had already been an hour so and we only move to the half way market .About ten minutes later I stopped playing slapps with my dad because my hands were beat red and his hands were barrely even red if that .So we just waited and waited until we were there three quarters  the way there .After about ten to twenty minutes later we were boarding the raft .We went through a cave then stopped like fourty  feet then splashed in to a huge amount of water .It turns out that wait was worth it .So that is a time when I showed patients.."
