"ô@CAPS1 on hurry up,ö my friend said. ôI know, be patient,ö I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed. Being patient is all ways a good thing have you ever heard something like ôPatience is a virtue? Well if you donÆt get used to it."
