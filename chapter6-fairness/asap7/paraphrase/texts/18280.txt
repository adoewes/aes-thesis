"One time I went to the doctors. The docter said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said a nother docter will come in. we waited three hours in that room. My mom was mad, they forgot about us. The docter that was spose to come in went in the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots and I hate shots. In conclusion. I learned my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the docters so patience always has a reward."
