"A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive. It is the funniest place to go to. I was so happy I couldn∆t wait until we got there. I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandma∆s cottage I didn∆t complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient don∆t go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person."
