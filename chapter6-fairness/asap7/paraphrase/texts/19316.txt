"One time when I was patient was when I broke my thumb I was patient cause I wasnt complaining about it wasnt crying about. Really wasnt doing enthing cause I didn∆t think it was even broken. I wasnt really bothered me. Then I wait to the doctor and got it checked the docter didnt think it was broken cause I almost beat him in a thurb wreste but he x-rayed it just in case. When he came back with the x-rays he said it was broken, he was very suprised I was suprised every one was."
