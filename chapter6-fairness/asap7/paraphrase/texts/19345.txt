IÆm going to write about when I was patience. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone she said if I be patience I will be able to get a phone so I was patience. Time flew bye and family she sad yes see when I was patience to get a cell phone I got one. Have you ever been patience with your family? Tell me did it work out of did it go bad with your family if you are it probably will work for you.  And that is what happens when you are patience.
