"One time I was patient was when I was standing in a line at the petting zoo. The animal I was waiting in line to see, was a donkey. It was a hot @DATE1 day around three in the afternoon of course a donkey was the crowds favorite animal. There only a couple people observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was around the middle of the line. I was getting tired but I had see to this donkey! I was being very patient waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally only a couple people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey. A couple minutes passed old I was petting the donkey: @CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo, happy. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a bat on the back."
