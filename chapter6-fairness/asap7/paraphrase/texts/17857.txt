One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gum as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the ÊA∆ team and the Ê@CAPS1∆ team. Finally there was about @NUM1 other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was @CAPS2!  At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the Ê@CAPS1∆ team. Although it wasn∆t the ÊA∆ team I was still happy I didn∆t get out. That was a day I had to be very patient.
