"Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school how do you use patience. A way is being understanding to your teacher because they∆re there to help you to teach you for life. If you don∆t be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them they were tolerant with you. If you don∆t have patience with you parents and don∆t listen to them then you won∆t learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life."
