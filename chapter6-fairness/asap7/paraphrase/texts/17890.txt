"My sister is very patient unlik my brothers and me. Well my sibling and me had are proggress reports coming and I was so excited to see what I got, and my brothers were anxious and we work always both a mom saying when are they coming did you them. But my sister was always calm and patient. Then the day they arrived we then got nervous except @PERSON1. The reason why she is patient is because she trys to keep off her mind by sleeping or reading. But back to report cards we opened them and then everyone was happy even @CAPS1 because we got good grades. Then after that my brothers and me learned from my sister and now we all have patience."
