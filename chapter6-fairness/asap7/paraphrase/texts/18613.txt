"Last month, I had to go get a root canal. I was very nervous .I arrived at the dentist office , half scared  to death by the of the pain , there two people in front  of me so I had to wait , which made me more scared. The  time had come for me to go with the dentist . I was patient the whole  time .After it was done ,I was fine ,it didn∆t even hurt .When I got home ,I fell asleep , I woke up in pain though ,my tooth felt on fire. I never complained though, and when my mom was trying to hurry and my medicine, I never yelled at her to hurry or cried .This was the time that I was patient."
