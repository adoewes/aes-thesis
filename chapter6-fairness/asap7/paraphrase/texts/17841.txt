Un Patience @CAPS1.   My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And that∆s when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is.
