"One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet exspress. So we had to wait in this big line. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I shold of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing. We were the first people in line so that was a go thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun."
