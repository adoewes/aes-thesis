"I awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort @PERSON1. It was @NUM1 my mom was on time prepare ???. I was in a hurry to get going. Today was the day that the x-box @NUM2 came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running arch I could get it. As an hour past we arrived at the grcery state. I darted inside and grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any ginks of being impatient. After what see made like hours we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn∆t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to best buy to buy the x-box @NUM2. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day."
