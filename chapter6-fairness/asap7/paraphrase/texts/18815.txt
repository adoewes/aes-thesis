"Sometimes being patient is hard @CAPS5 IÆve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. IÆve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see @CAPS3 my presents @CAPS5 their were none. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, ô@CAPS2.ö @CAPS3 she said back was ô@CAPS2, why are you up this early?ö I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say ôhappy birthdayö @CAPS5 yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until @NUM2: pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient I got a good party and now IÆm patient every day."
