"On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tried & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another dies but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & @CAPS1 I aimed & fired! Well thatÆs what I thought but no it was jamed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked ôwhat are you doing.ö @CAPS1 I said ôI see a doe,ö @CAPS1 he said ôthen shoot it,ö & it stood there @CAPS1 I shot again & then it ran away, ôI missedö I said all that patience for nothing."
