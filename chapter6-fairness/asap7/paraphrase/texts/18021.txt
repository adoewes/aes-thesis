I was patient because I didnÆt want to get really excited about @CAPS2 .When I get excited about things we have a change in plans, and we would have to æcancel. So I stayed callö and we was in the car in a little over an hear then my brother forgot something and we had to go back and got @CAPS2 and I was patience about @CAPS2, ??? we was quiet the whole way there I had is the story when I was very patient about going to @LOCATION1."
