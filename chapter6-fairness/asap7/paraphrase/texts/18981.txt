"I was patient when I had to wait in a very long line at leader @CAPS1 amusment park! In @LOCATION1 I had to wait for @NUM1 hours for the ride, The @CAPS2. It went from @CAPS3 to @NUM2 in @CAPS4! When going @NUM2 the coast went strate up then, stoped at the top (@NUM4 yard) we just sat their for like  @NUM5 sec! Then it moved and we went strate down at @NUM6 it was relly cool! It was werth the wait. That was the time I was patient!"
