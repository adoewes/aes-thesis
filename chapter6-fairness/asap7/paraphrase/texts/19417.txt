"When I was @NUM1 years old, I went to my first doctor's appointment it was extremely nerve naking. I sat in a chair next to my mom, shaping, wondering, non-stop for @NUM2. I was running around and when I finally sat down I said."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! I couldn't be patient anyone. So it walked out the door, when the nerve called your next."" And I was like ,"" well that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 and a ? , "" @CAPS4 it's only @NUM4 and we got here at @TIME1 "" @CAPS5 that wasn't long,"" my mom said. Next time when I go to the doctor I will be extra patient."
