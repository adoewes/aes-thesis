"Have you ever got annoid because someone kept saying be patient? I have and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about the time I was patient. One time I was on my way to @LOCATION1, the plane ride wasn∆t as bad as what @CAPS1 gonna tell you. When @CAPS3 got to @PERSON1 @CAPS3 had to pass through @PERSON1@NUM1 border it was hot!!! I think tempeture hit @NUM2? @CAPS3 had to wait in this small room with about @NUM3 people, and they had no A. C. All of us were waiting for the bus to come, and after @NUM4 hours a bus arrived. @CAPS3 were getting on as about @NUM5 people came barging in front, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 miss that bus. Then @CAPS3 waited again for a bus the after @NUM6 hours a bus arrives agains @CAPS2 were trying get on then again @CAPS3 get pushed out of the way. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus I was @CAPS2 fustrated @CAPS2 did my family. Another thing I got frustrated at was there were thousand∆s of flys all over the place. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 waited after @NUM4 more hours a bus arrives but my little brother was in the bathroom @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus @CAPS2 my mom was telling me to calm down and be patient @CAPS2 I stayed patient until the @NUM8 th bus came, @CAPS3 got on but the bus didn∆t go where @CAPS3 were suppose to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had to go back to the same place @CAPS3 were in, but again my mom says stay patient. One of the officers over at the place saw how long @CAPS3 were waiting @CAPS2 once the next bus arrived after @NUM9 hours and @NUM10 minutes he held everybody else up let me and my family get on, and tolled the driver Ùtake them by there self,ˆ @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had the bus to our selfs, and you know what it was all worth it."
