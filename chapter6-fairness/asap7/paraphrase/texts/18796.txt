"I have been patient lots of times in my life but this time was really hard to be patient because I was so exited about building. Left in my reach we had been planting it for a while now and we started on a @DATE1 after school was over we got like half of it done that day but there we couldn∆t work on it again for a week because my brother, sister, dad, and mom all had ?? or ?? so I had to wait a week  just to work on it again. It was really hard to be patient this time thogh because I had been waiting to do this for a while. After a week finally passed, it seemed like a month but now I could finish my work and I was so exited. A few days later we finally finished the walls painted a blue and gold for u of @CAPS1 and my left as all we had to do was put my dad in my left then it was ready to sleep in. I was so happy that we had finally finished my room and I could sleep in it."
