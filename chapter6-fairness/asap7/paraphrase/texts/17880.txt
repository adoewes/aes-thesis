"Swimming is a lot of fun. I enjoy feeling the cool water all around me. Patience is an important part of the swimming you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke learning a new way to turn at the wall, ect. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening. Patience is important."
