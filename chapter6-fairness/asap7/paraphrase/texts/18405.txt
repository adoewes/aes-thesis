My mom was patient when she was in line for her drivers licence it took three hours to get her drivers licence. She was angry but she was patient. And the lady that would give the drivers licence took a break when she came back my mom waited another three hours an she still was patient I was there too and I was patient but I wanted to yell at the lady for taking a break and making us wait for her for one extra hour. And another time my mom waited in line under the rum it was burning the only thing she did to cool down was drink for about two hours under eithy one degrees an she was still patient.
