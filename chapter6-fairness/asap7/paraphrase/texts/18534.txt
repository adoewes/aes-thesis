"One time my friend told me to read this book, so l borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called ÙThe @CAPS1 @CAPS2ˆ. It∆s also a tv show on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named @PERSON2, brother of @PERSON1 are vampires. They turned into a @CAPS1 because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 died because they were trying to save @PERSON3, or so everyone thought. @PERSON3 gave them enough blood so they wouldn∆t die, they would become a @CAPS1. They thought @PERSON3 was in the tume because that was were everyone was taking the vampires because the town found out there was vampires there. @PERSON2 came back after @NUM1 years searching for something to help get @PERSON3 out of the tume, I think that is patience. Waiting for @NUM1 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don∆t complain while doing it."
