"The time I was patient as when I was getting my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. We were walking past a last chance rescue and we went to see the puppies. My mom didn∆t want another dog but when she saw our future dog boxter she gave in. he has grey fur with some black spots and and a black line running down his fore. At the center of the ???. He was a grown short hair blue healer mix. We asked the lady if we could get him but she said they are going in sport and we could buy him there. We got in the car and ??? to ???. we signed the forms and played with him in the store. But ??? down town with him on the sosh and we got some ice cream and went home."
