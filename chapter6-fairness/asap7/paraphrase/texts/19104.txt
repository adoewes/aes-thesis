"My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt∆s girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt∆s girlfriend two dollars."
