A time of when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to alow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldn∆t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad∆s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn∆t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn∆t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and over joyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!
