One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming  out. I asked my dad @CAPS1 we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until @CAPS2. So I waited until @CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents @CAPS4 and & me my brother went to play it.
