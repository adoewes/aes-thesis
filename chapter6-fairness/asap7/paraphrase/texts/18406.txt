"The time I was unpatient. On the day of @DATE1, I rose out of bed brushed my teeth got dreest and ate break feast then me, my mom, and my brother drove to the doctors. Whitch is an hour from our house. I was not happy because  I was tired and just thinking about how long @CAPS1 going to be sitting their just waiting for the doctor to say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 but no I got to sit their sit their staring at the walls. Soo know were here and @CAPS1 just soo happy to sit and waite because my mom did tell me thousands of times ôyou need to stop being so unpatient,ö well I cainte help it. Any way my mom just signed in for me so I guess IÆll just look at magizeens boring boring boring. They donÆt even have people magizeeing ôcome onö I said my mom said ôyou need to waite @CAPS1 sure they will call your name any secound,ö well not any secound because its been about @NUM1 boring min. ooh lookie here time for lunch but no we have to still just sit here and waite. Gosh IÆm so hungry. Well finlly the doctor just called my name and itÆs time to wait again! In conclusion theirs a time I was unpatient I was un patient waiting at the doctors just sitting their thats why if it has something to do with waiting ôIÆm not interested.ö"
