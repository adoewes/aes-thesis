"Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up wen she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2à @NUM3à @NUM4à and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which  took about a year not really could not tell by her expression then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing myself!"
