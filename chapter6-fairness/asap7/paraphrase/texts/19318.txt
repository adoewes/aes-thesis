"Sometimes its hard to be patient, especilly when you have to be tolerant to little kids. Well I have to do that sometimes, when I go to visit my little cousin, @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 is eight years old and get on my nervers. She asks dumb questions and does stupid things and I don't like her at all. My mom says, ""When you grow up, you two will be best friends,"" @CAPS1, right, I don't think so. When ever I visit her I just have to tolerant her and be patient. For now I have to deal with her, but when we grow up we might become  friends, but maybe not."
