"When I was little we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally big enugh to go on the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ! When we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there. The line looked as if it were five miles long ! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for ! I was not oppernutity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking. It took what felt like two days to get to top. My mom and I were so patient !So we waited ,and waited ,and waited .Till we were finally at the top .Then we came down .It had been worth the wait ! we were so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great accomplishment. I never knew I could be so patient and my mom and I could wait so long."
