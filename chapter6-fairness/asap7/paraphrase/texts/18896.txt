Patience @CAPS1 and my mom were sitting on the coach and we were going to go to the store to get groceries then go to school cloth shoping.  My sistr didnÆt really wonÆt to go but my mom made her so she was already mad about that but we went and got food that she apparently ôdinÆt likeö but she just being her normal! Self esteem and greedy. ôwe are hereö said my mom we are at @CAPS2 to go shopping to my sister. She dosenÆt like @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 or are like I do  mabe cause she dosent think she can fit them but anyways we do in and she dosent see anything ôshe likesö so she starts throwing a tempestan ?? my mom was so patient with her. I couldent belive it so we lost to of her name and she took @CAPS1 to my spares.
