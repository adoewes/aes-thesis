One time my @CAPS3 planned a fishing trip to @LOCATION1. @CAPS8 @CAPS1∆t know. He told me to pack my suit case for three days worth of clothes I said why he said we are going to @LOCATION1 tomorrow with your causins @PERSON1 and ryan. I was so excited that I flew to my room and pounded cloths in my @CAPS2 and looked through everything I would need. I asked my @CAPS3 what we were doing there he said were going on a fishing trip in the @CAPS4 river for pike. The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin real. So I got my fishing poles ready packed my @CAPS7 and went to sleep so I could get up early. @NUM1 am come and my alarm went off I was so tierd I could barely see @CAPS8 we had to be at my uncles house at @NUM2 so I had to get ready. Once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car @CAPS8 I couldn∆t once we got in @LOCATION1 it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even sas a bear @CAPS10 a river that we stopped at then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole withe millions of frog in it. When we finally got there my @CAPS3 made me wait and unpack. Once me and my causin got @CAPS12 unpacking we went right to the store to fish my first cast I caught a little @NUM3 incher on a @ORGANIZATION1. After that we caught nothing so we came back up when it got @CAPS13 and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake @CAPS10 the @LOCATION3 we caught nothing. That night we went fishing on the @CAPS4 river and we still caught nothing. The guy that owned the cabin said we should cath @NUM4 or @NUM5 pike a @CAPS5 @CAPS8 it had rained seven feet so they wern∆t feeding. The next @CAPS5 we got up early again and fished all @CAPS5. In the morning I had one hit we had nothing afterward. At lunch we found a little @LOCATION2 to eat lunch on it had a actual rock cave and we had scared a bear off the @LOCATION2. Later we went to this little canyon that was really hard to clime I almost fell halfway @CAPS19 @CAPS8 I got looked on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we video taped and we killed a chipmunk with a @CAPS21 rock that we threw @CAPS19. Wham it almost took my pole I fought it for about ten minutes I waited and waited it was a digantic pike @CAPS8 it shapped my line and I still have never seen that pike.
