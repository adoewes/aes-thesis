"ô@CAPS1 @CAPS8! Really?ö it was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at @LOCATION1 pritz. The forcast was @CAPS8. @CAPS8 and @CAPS1 @CAPS8. The tigers were play the ô@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.ö @PERSON1 was pitching for the @CAPS4 and justin @CAPS6 for the tigers. My dad + my mom and my brother and I were just two rows from the front row. It was the bottom of the first and I feel a huge drop of @CAPS8 touch my head. Then I feel another than another. ô@CAPS7 upstairs for shelter!ö my dad yelled. As soon as we got up in the selter area complete down poor. ThatÆs all I have to say. The players went into the dugduts. My mom called my grand pa to see what the forecast is. ô@CAPS8.ö @CAPS9 said. My mom took her sweatshirt off and gave it to me and my brother and said ôits gonna be a long @TIME1 so rest up nowö at first I didnÆt understand. But after she explained to me I knew it was indeed gonna be long. At the time of this I was only @NUM1 or @NUM2 so waiting is not really my thing. An hour past by it was still raining. @NUM3 hours, than, @NUM4, than finally 41/@NUM3 hours past by. It was @NUM6 at @TIME1! The game still wasnÆt starting. My mom called my grandpa again. @CAPS9 said we still have another good hour of @CAPS8 left. We sat there for ever! Me and my family were so bored. But my mom said patience will pay off. @NUM7 ? hours later. It cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us. We were ready to watch a game at @NUM8 am! My dad bought all of us ice cream for being so patiente. The game ended at @NUM9! we only stayed till @NUM4.00 though because of the drive. In the end I got to see an awesome baseball game (and get ice cream.) I learned patience pays off!"
