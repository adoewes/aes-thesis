"Are you patient?well I am always patient.Iam going to tell you a time when I was patient at school.One day I had to register for school it was very busy.I had to wait to every line atleast to ten to fifteen minutes.When I finally got all my paper work done,I had to take my id picture.When I took the pictures I went to get my id.All of a sudden it comes out,but my eyes were closed.So I had to wait in the line again and take more pictures.Then I went to take my other id. I waited very long,like about twenty minutes.My second id came out and it was messed up.T he lady told me when I start school,I will get the correct one.That is a time when I was patient in my life."
