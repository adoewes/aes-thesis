"I amwriting a story about a time when I was patient, When I was in @NUM1 grade I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1. I ordered with my mom and dad and waited. The waiter said about @NUM2 minutes. Our food didn∆t come after @NUM2 minutes or @NUM4 or @NUM5 or @NUM6 or even @NUM7 minutes. Our food came after an hour and @NUM8 minutes. All the time i was waiting  I was getting more and more hungry. I didn∆t start complaining or yelling I sat in my seat and waited patiently."
