"Ahh! I screamed in my mind. Baby sitting my cousin took a lot more patience. ( more her than me) @CAPS1 all at started on a @DATE1 @TIME1 my family went to go do some drink (I stayed behind to work on my homework) A little after my mom left I heard a knock on the door.  My aunt come in and whispered ""you most??? @CAPS1 was okay is if I left @CAPS2"" @CAPS3 I replied  ""okay"" @CAPS4 was asleep for about half- an hour. When I woke up @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 started crying. First thing I did was pick her up and carry her around. Still @CAPS4 was crying! @CAPS3 I thought her cloth need changing. I changed her cloth and??? Keeps crying. Now I had to keep my patience though because who would yell at a baby. Then I thought @CAPS4 was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle though @CAPS3 I had to read??? (@CAPS4 had no patience all @CAPS4 want was  her bottle) @CAPS5 when I was about to lose my patience I made a bottle bat sure if @CAPS1 was good) but @CAPS4 drank @CAPS1. Finally I put her back to sleep (if @CAPS4 cried one more time. I would do finally lose my patience) @CAPS6 @CAPS4 was sleeping @CAPS4 looked in peaceful until @CAPS4 woke up. @CAPS4 started crying again (this time I knew why because @CAPS4 likes to be carried).By the time my aunt came back my hands hare sore. Although at the end of the day I figured out, that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby you need way more patience for a younger brother though trust me)."
