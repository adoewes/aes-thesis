"A momma bird was laying eggs. She layed @NUM1 butiful, blue, perfect eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""@CAPS1 be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the @NUM2 oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""@CAPS2 can't I fly yet"" and momma said,"" @CAPS1 be patient."""
