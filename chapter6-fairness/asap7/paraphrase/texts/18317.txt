It was the day of central @LOCATION1 and it was after school that I was in the paraid with my football team and the line was going really slow and eventally we have done and it was off the home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well his preparing me and I went to his house and played a little and then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1∆s there were about @NUM1 cars and they were all in the drive through and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didn∆t start until @NUM2 and it was @NUM3. So we sat there patiently and ordered are food and left to go to the football game. And that∆s a time when I was patient.
