"Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; Ùyou are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.ˆ @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn∆t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn∆t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn∆t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn∆t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn∆t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!"
