A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game I played for the destroyer∆s. So in all the game∆s I always had to wait to the @DATE2. So in the @DATE1 game of the season I got in four times. In the first @DATE2 I got in for about one minute. the I got in for @NUM1 minutes in the @DATE1∆s. I was happy but I still wasn∆t starting. then we got into the play off∆s I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teamate∆s came up to me and said don∆t worry your gonna your time to start everyone will. Over the next few month∆s I waited patiently. Then we got in tournament∆s then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoff∆s then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient.
