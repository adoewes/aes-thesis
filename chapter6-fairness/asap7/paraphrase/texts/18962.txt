"One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tryed to get it off. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me trying to get it off. When we realized it wasent coming off we had to find the @CAPS1. When we found him we asked for bolt cutters. We had o walk all the way across the school to get them. Once we had them we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there he tryed to cut the lock. He tryed for @NUM2 min. They wouldent work. So we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This one finally cut the lock after @NUM3 min. I think this took a lot of patients from coach @PERSON1."
