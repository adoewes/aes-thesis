"ô@CAPS1 were gonna be late!ö yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily. ô@CAPS1 were gonna be late!ö yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily.You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parmls, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was estaric. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1Æs parents before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to ???? ô@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I asked safely, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seamed to grow twice their size. ô@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4!  Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!ö @PERSON1 yelled??? . Though she made it sound like ô???ö I smilled and we began tro play. She would guess??? I would let her win. ??? was so ??? and I think I made her more patoient to leave by helping her play a game.Finally my parents walked outside and we began our skitrip. Patience had payed off."
