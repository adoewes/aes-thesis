"One day a man named @PERSON1 had a doctor∆s appointment and over slept; when @PERSON1 got out of bed he saw that he was late for his doctor∆s appointment. As @PERSON1 got out of bed he rushed in the bathroom to take a quick shower, as if he had time. @PERSON1 noticed   it was grilling later so he didn∆t get to wash up or brush his teeth, so he grabbed a part of gum on the way out the door. @PERSON1 finally got to the doctors went inside and saw there were millions of people in the waiting  room, he went to go check his name in and sat down. He started to get frustrated and tired   of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @PERSON1 kept his self busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and many apps he downloaded. @PERSON1 was so busy he didn∆t realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check-ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called   in @LOCATION1 for his appointment. As @PERSON1 was going in he put @NUM1, maybe @NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 was done, zoomed home, flew into his the shower, and brushed his teeth, got back in the bed and went to sleep."
