"Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the ôaliensö. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesnÆt cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that ô@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.ö @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isnÆt true he will defend you. He says, ôits not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, ôI tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.ö In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself."
