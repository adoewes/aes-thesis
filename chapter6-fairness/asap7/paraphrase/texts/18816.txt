"Last @DATE1 I went with some friends to the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 is about christan rock music. The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite christan rock band, @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost streched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave there lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky braclet. That was the time I was patient."
