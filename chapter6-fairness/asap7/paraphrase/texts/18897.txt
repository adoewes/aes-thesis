"It was @DATE1 and @PERSON4 was in class messing around at his desk like usual. @PERSON4 isnt usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and @PERSON4 had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers. @PERSON4Æs hand shot straight up in the air. One of the first hands raised. ô@CAPS1! Lots of answers.ö <@NUM1</PERSON> berry said. @PERSON1 berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see. But all of the students love her as an @CAPS2 teacher, ô@CAPS3 @CAPS4 whats your answer?ö @CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Okay @CAPS6.ö ô@CAPS7 language?ö @CAPS8 good answer thoughö. There were about @NUM2 more hands in the air. In @PERSON4Æs head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. ô@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people and then we will go @CAPS5.ö <@NUM1</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. ô@CAPS10ö. @PERSON3 said. ô@CAPS11 a metaphor?ö @CAPS10 answered. ô@CAPS13 youÆre right it was a metaphor.ö ô@CAPS14 darn it that was my answer!ö @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer @PERSON4 was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently."
