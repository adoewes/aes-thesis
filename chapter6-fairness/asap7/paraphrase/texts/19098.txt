"A time when I was patient was fishing with my grandpa up north and we were siting out there all day and we had to have trolled up and down the chanel at least @NUM1 times. And each time we got bites but we never caught any fish. We tried our usal routine but that wasnÆt working out so well, so I decided to change it up a bit. I gave my grandpa the idea of turning the boat around and heading towda shigle bay. He agred but the only problem was there were a lot of rocks were we were going and thats the last thing we need is for the prop to get broken off. But we took our chances and modered or we to were were were I direted him to go and as soon as we enter the bag bam! We see the pale bend down so far it was hard to believe it was a fish so I got the net and my grandpa grabed the pole and started to real we evently go it to the surface and it was a @NUM2ö wallege we smiled and said looks like were having  fish to night, this is the story of when my patients were being tested by fish and then I caught the biggest one in the lake!"
