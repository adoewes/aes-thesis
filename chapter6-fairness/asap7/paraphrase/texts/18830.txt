When I was getting ready to leave my uncles ranch. I was waiting patiently for my dad to get back so he could help my brother put the @NUM1 on to the tryler. It has been @NUM2 hours and my dad has not come back yet. I was having a difficult time taking my @NUM3 off the tryler because it was to heavy and my dad was still riding his @NUM3. When my dad got back my brother went to go ride his @NUM3. I was having a very difficult time trying to get everything and leave but finally my mom and sister wanted to leave to so they finally helped me.
