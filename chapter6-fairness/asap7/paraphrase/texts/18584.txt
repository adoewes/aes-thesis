"Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better."
