"The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get @DATE1 film out of my camera my mom always promises me to get the film but sense her money was use on ??? She told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. So I waited @DATE1 @DATE1 have crine up and this is what happened I ask my mom again can I get my film out of my camera. She said no because she used her money??? school supples. I was happened to wait another @DATE1 @DATE1 so @DATE1 @DATE1 came again. I ask her and she said no because once again she spend her money no paying people back from them helping her out like any dad. So I had to wait until next @NUM1 @DATE1 so I waited, and waited, and finally @NUM1 @DATE1 has pass and she forgets so she had to get groceries. So @DATE1 I ask her one more time and she said. Yes but she had to pay my dad back on helping her and after that she said after school I??? bringing my film out to buy. So how now told you how??? I have waited to do that also had to get a new diginal camera because it has been droped to many time."
