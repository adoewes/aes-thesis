I am always patient. But  do you know when and were I am really patient? It is when I am getting my hair cut. Every time I go to get my hair cut it is a lot of people in the @CAPS1 shop. So day people say they have to go some were for a party or for church and need there hair cut pronto. So I let them cut and I have to wait and be patient. It makes me kind of happy to be patient because I am helping others and if I need someone to be very patient with me then I will want them to be patient.
