"Patience is a very long task @CAPS2 the rewards out weigh the time you waited for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up to a line to a rollar coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However many people are not very patient. (@CAPS1 me) @CAPS2 they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. In short, be @CAPS1 a trile and lots of patience."
