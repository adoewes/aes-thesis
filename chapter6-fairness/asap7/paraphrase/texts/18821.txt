"ô@CAPS1,when @CAPS5 we open presents?ö I asked. ô@CAPS2 we get back from churchö she replied. It was our typical @DATE1 schedual, make @CAPS3 eve dinner all day, go to the @CAPS3 eve service , have grand parents for dinner than all the kids get to open one present than go to bed for about one hour get up , and open more presents.  Amen,ö our pastor concluded the service ô@CAPS5 we go now, @CAPS1?ö I blubbered ô@CAPS6ö she said.@CAPS8 we ate dinner I felt like I had ants in my pants, I was so excited. time seemed to go by so slow I was @NUM1 years old before my grand parents left. Finally we were all gathered around the @CAPS3 tree @CAPS8 I was about to open my present. All it was was a sleeping bag than my dad said,ö you @CAPS5 all sleep on the floor in @LOCATION1 room, but be sure you go to bed.ö @CAPS8 I was laying on the floor, while my sister was sound asleep, I was thinking, I wonder what Iæll get for @CAPS3. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning at @NUM2. I jumped out of bed woke my sister up and ran into my parents room to wake them up. I was thinking finally we get to open presents. That was a time where I had to be very patient. But it was all paid off in the end."
