"Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacher∆s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient."
