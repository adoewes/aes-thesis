"A time I was patient was @DATE1, when I was in line to ride the dragster in @CAPS1 point. I was super hot day, I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were geting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever. Just as we were about to go on the ride they steped us because the ride wasen∆t working right. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckly my best firend and I had good patients unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experences of my life. ÙI∆m so happy we waitedˆ said @PERSON1 my best firend. Some people have patient like  @PERSON1 and I, and some don∆t like the the people who ran of there. I∆m glade we waited or that would not have happened. In this case patient was a great thing for @PERSON1 and I."
