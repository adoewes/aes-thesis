"One time I was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile. Since it∆s a relay one person goes to run a mile, then the second person goes once the first person I done, after that the third person goes after the second person is done with his mile, then finally after the third person went I got to go run a mile because I was the fastest at running a mile. Since I had to wait until the very end I had to have patience to wait and then finally go."
