"I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots. Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didn∆t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it."
