"This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the @TIME1, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, ôitÆs time to go, @CAPS1!ö I replied ôokay!ö I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my momÆs car. It was the middle of @DATE1, and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the @CAPS2 player for me and my brother @CAPS3 to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies whele everyone else was asleep. Exect for my dad of course he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to @LOCATION1. I was ??? to  get there, I burst out of the car and yelled ôfinallyö That was the story of how I Was patient."
