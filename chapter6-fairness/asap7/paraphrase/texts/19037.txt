My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it had to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldn∆t get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to re do it over five time I know it wouldn∆t be able to be that patient without loseing  it.
