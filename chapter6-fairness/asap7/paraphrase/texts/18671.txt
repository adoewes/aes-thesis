"Waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life, I love the way A song can make you feel, I love how walking a line on the @ORGANIZATION1 can change your day. As a young musician I all I can ever think about is music, I had reache my @NUM1 instrument @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, the only instrument my family owns I can∆t play is the bass. So when my @ORGANIZATION2 broke I took mr.groth up on his need for a @CAPS3 in @CAPS4 band. I studied my butt of learning the art of the bass @ORGANIZATION1, reading the clef and learning the notes, I was waiting for my ranking to increase and memorization and I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better and it seemed each week I got better and better. I had easily fell in love with the sounds it made and I had found  I  loved it way more than the @ORGANIZATION2, shure it will take time to become a pro but I u learned its worth it ."
