"Once, I was @NUM1 old and I was so eager about getting a new bike I didn't have no patience at all, so that day I asked my dad can I get a new bike ""he said not now"" ""I said pleaseee"" he said later then, after that day my dad was getting dressed  I said yes!! That's for my bike so. I went to my dad and I told him I'm ready ""he said what"" were are you going I said with you then he said no not now, I got so angry and went and sat down. After an hour has been gone my dad showed up, so I ran so fast and said can we go now he said ali be patient, I said why you said we are going to go, so my dad parked the car and went downstairs and ate lunch. So I started to get angry I went to the couch and sat their and watched @CAPS1 while my dad was eating. After he was done he said ali lets go!! I said where, to? buy you a bike I ran so fast and hugged my dad and went and got dressed. After I got my new bike and I was patient."
