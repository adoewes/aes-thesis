A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch. That the time when I was patient over something.
