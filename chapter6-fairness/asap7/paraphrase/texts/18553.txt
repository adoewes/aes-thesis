"Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you don∆t have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday."
