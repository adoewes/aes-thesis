"A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasn∆t earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldn∆t find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didn∆t enjoy."
