A time I was patiet was when I was wating for my mom to pick me up from school at @TIME1. School end∆s at @NUM1 so I had to wait out side for an hour and a half almost. It was winter at the time so it was about @NUM2 f degrees. It was vary windy too so I used my instrument case to block the wind and snow from my face. But that did not help much becaus I could not feel my face and I saw a clock inside the school and I found I had only been here @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow was terrible I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot choclate then @DATE1 then it was florida in @DATE1 on a hot day. But I was staying patient as I could but it was vary hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my moms car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient.
