"When I think of being  patient I think about the time I went to southrend @LOCATION1 for hockey, we were on the road for @NUM1 ? hours! While  we were on the way there i didnÆt say one thing about how much longer or anything, although I was on a claster bus with all my hockey friends wathing a hockey movie. When I think of patients I think of wating without asking  ô@CAPS1 it done yet?ÆÆ or ôAre we there yet?ö I myself dont have the best patients. when I want the computer or to role the guard or frarwheeler and someone was on those things I tend to ask ôwhen will he be dane!ö alot. Patients grows with you when you develop, as you get older you will be able to wait longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long even this test takes patients!"
