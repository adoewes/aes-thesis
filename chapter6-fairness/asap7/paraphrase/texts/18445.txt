"Patience can come in different was in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because it would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm. For example, people can∆t wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second wouldn∆t be so hard because you would be calm. That is patience in my own way."
