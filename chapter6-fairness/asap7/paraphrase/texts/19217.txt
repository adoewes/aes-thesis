"Last year, @DATE1 it was my birthday, so I told my @CAPS1 what I wanted for my @DATE3 and out of everything I said ô@CAPS1 I want a @CAPS2ö (@CAPS3 station @CAPS4). So the @DATE2 we go out at three in the morning to get my @ORGANIZATION1 and we were at best buy. So we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over @DATE4 people in the store. So we walk over to the game. I she and their was two text and their was five people in the section so we grabed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at @TIME1. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my @CAPS2, werever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect."
