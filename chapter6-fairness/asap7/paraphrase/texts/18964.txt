"A long wait   @CAPS1 Êonly four∆ at the time. I had moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didn∆t care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasn∆t four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn∆t hate the idea but I didn∆t love it either. Of course. It didn∆t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn∆t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I∆ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I don∆t get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I∆ll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can∆t wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity !"
