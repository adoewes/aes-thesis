"A time that I was patient is when I had my twelth birthday. All of my friends exept one, wanted to keep playing. So we did. We desited to go and walk the dogs, and then have dinner, and then open presints. When we were all done with that, we opend my presints, I was very excited to see them. That is a time that I was patient. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first. Pluss in the end, I got a lot of exiting stuff and I relized that wating, and doing what my friends wanted to do first was a great idea. IÆm pretty schure that we all had a great time."
