An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you don∆t get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don∆t get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don∆t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person.
