"A lot of people are patient and they wait because they don∆t want to make someone mad or mess-up something that they are doing. People always be careful of what they are doing. I ever be patient sometimes and its not that hard to be patient it is pretty easy. Everyone absouletly knows that, those people are out their, they know, trust me. Theirs many different things that∆ve been patient for, but I don∆t know which one I choose to write, cause there is alot of them. Ù@CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, wait patiently but @CAPS1 you can∆t or can∆t hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use other one, or @CAPS1 someone on the computer then wait for your turn, but @CAPS1 its been pass in an hour then tell that person to get off not to be mean, but you either need on and have your turn. There is no way you can∆t be patient for at leat @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes. Not too hard. It∆s pretty easy and everyone knows that too you know."
