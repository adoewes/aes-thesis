I was patient when my dog had to go the @CAPS1 he was really sick becaus he had heart worms my mom and I just whated for about two hour's I was not as patint as my mom because I keep asking my mom what was going on. After the operation was down we had to whate even longer intill we got my dog bare back almost @NUM1 hours. After the @CAPS1 called us we went and got my dog and the doctor sed that he had to water in till he could be up and moving and it was finly ok and we played in the snow all @CAPS3 long.
