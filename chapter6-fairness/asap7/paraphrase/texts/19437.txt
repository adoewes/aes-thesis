A time when I was patient was when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was waiting to get on the dragster the line was suppa long. We waited for @NUM1 hours long and we still was in line being patient. Finally we got up there and they said that the ride will be closed   for a while that have to check something and it took them a whole hour for them to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park and we were waiting for the train to come and it came it took the train @NUM2 minutes and when we got to the other side of the park the ride I wanted to get on which was shoot the rapids the line was really long so we waited and waited and finally it was our turn we got on it was fun then when it was over we got back. On the train and went back to the other side. We went back to the dragster then the line was back long and we waited and waited and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait that was my first day that I ever had to hold my patience that long I was about to lose my mind but we had don. And we are going back this @CAPS3.
