"The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride shoot the @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. Frist @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patients we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was to long of a wait. I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting but it was worth it when i got to ride. As you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it.When people push you just had to stay calm and be patient."
