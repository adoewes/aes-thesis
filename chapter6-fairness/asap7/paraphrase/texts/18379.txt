I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off.
