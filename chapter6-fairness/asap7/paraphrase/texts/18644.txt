"A time when I was patient was when I waiting in the hospital One time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing. When we got to the hospital we couldn∆t go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, uncle were just sitting waiting very patiently. When the next day came we still couldn∆t see her which was sad and scary. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital my mom was very upset because we couldn∆t see her at all. The doctor came out and said we can see her. When we got into the room she was sitting up smiling. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see you. My granny scud the doctor said it wasn∆t a really big deal. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left but my mom stayed.            In conclusion I told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didn∆t and we stayed very calm. This is the time I was patient."
