"Can you @CAPS1 a time in your life when you had to wait for something for a very long time. I had to wait for a long time. Do you think you knew what it is?ö it was @CAPS2 eve. I was only five at the time. So I woke upon @CAPS2 eve couldnt wait till tomorrow. I told my self that all day. I went outside to try and waste some time but that didnÆt help because it was freezing out side. So had to come right back in the house. I didnÆt have nothing to do. So I just kept wait, then ô@CAPS4ö my brother got up and I just played with him the whole day till we had to go to sleep. Then it was time to go to bed and I ran straight up to my bed room and got right to bed and woke up the next morning and I was so happy that I  didnÆt had to wait anymore. I had to wait for ever I was  so happy that day but know @CAPS5 thirteen and I real donÆt care anymore but I would still love to hear about your step to someday."
