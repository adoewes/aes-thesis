"ô@CAPS1, how much longer.ö I complained at the airport, ô@CAPS2 have been waiting for about two hours now.ö ô@CAPS3 will only be a couple more minutes sweety.ö replied my @CAPS1 in a stern voice. ô@CAPS3 better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to @CAPS5 world.ö I complained again. As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport full of people. @CAPS2 had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I havenÆ@CAPS8 said anything to my @CAPS1 the past two hours or three hours. I didnÆ@CAPS8 want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed,@CAPS2 boarded our plane finally. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but memoriable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats my @CAPS1 said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my @CAPS1 and dad donÆ@CAPS8 like to fly to places any more."
