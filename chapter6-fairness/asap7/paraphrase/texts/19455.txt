"There are many times I was patient, but this one was not to long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the meap. I just sat there finished, just read and drawed. It was absolutely boring, lame, and seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didn∆t complain I just sat there and did nothing. And that was probably worst time when I want to talk but couldn∆t."
