They all couldn∆@CAPS1 wait to see the movie that night. Finally the time come to go get the tickets. When @PERSON1 got there, a huge line was already formed. @PERSON1  was waiting, then she realized her best friend, @PERSON2, was in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up her lime. Her name was @CAPS2. She walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra money for a better seat and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn∆@CAPS1 get in line when she got there, more people got in line. But all that time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were talking. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets cause she was not patient."
