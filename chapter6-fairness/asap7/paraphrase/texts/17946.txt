I am writing about a time when I was patient. Me myself @CAPS1 not a patient person. One time I had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. We were waiting on the bus to come but I was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come. So my mother said ô@CAPS2 stop complanning and be patient @CAPS1 serious!ö so as soon as I sat down the bus came!
