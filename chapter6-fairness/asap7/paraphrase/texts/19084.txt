"One time I was patient when my little brother was taking a shower and I had to go to the bathroom. So I waited and of cource he locked the door so I tried to pick it with a toothpick, it didn∆t work. Then I told my dad and he said Ùbe a man you can hold it inˆ so that didn∆t work either so I was just about to take the door off the hinges and then he walked right out and smiled at me so then I went in the bathroom and it was soaked in water so I yelled at him and that∆s wen I was patient."
