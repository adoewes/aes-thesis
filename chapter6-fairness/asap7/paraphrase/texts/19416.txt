When I was at universal studios and I was waiting in the long lines to get on the rides I was patient. It did take a while but I never got mad or impatient. My dad and I was in a line for this dragon rollercoaster we were so close to being next then it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left so we ended up being in the front of the line. We waited for another hour or two but it never stoped. We forgot about my mom and brothers so we left. I was patient the whole time. We went and got in line for one of the new rides they just got and since it new the line was long. We waited for quit a while. We eventually got on the ride and we realized the wait was worth it so we went again.
