"I have lived in a lot of different. Places through out my life. They are @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 and @CAPS2. That's @CAPS3 different place. @CAPS6 was and still is land to about to @CAPS6 @CAPS4 somewhere along that long road in @LOCATION2 my parents got devased. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually @PERSON2. We moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom (my sister and me). @CAPS6 was fun there because @CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandma for about six years. @CAPS4 I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months. My grandma says to not to moving and till see him soon. By soon @CAPS6 didn't think like meant @NUM2 months. In those @NUM2 months we wanted a house neat to a patch of works and a fresh water @DATE1. My mom even got a boyfriend that she later broke up with. Then later she started and still is dating the guy we are renting awe house from. When my dad called and said that he was coming, @CAPS6 made me. So happy. @CAPS6 @CAPS7 didn't that @CAPS6 could make @CAPS6 @NUM4 months without seeing my dad.  @CAPS4 @CAPS6 did @CAPS6. Now that he's settled in a see him once a match for one weekend. With better than @NUM4 months or not at all."
