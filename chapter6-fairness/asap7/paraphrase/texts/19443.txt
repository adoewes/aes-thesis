"I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I was patient for about four months. I was waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. And I was extremely patient for this. So basically what happened was that there was this new, high tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 . Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out. So for christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad wake me up. He said that they were selling alot of @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to watiest, and waited in the line for a long time. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up. The next day, I finally played my @CAPS1: And thats a story about a time I have been patient."
