"There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the I can remember the most was when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2Æd been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when @CAPS2 heard an announcement. ô@CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane but @CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour.ö @CAPS2 eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement ôIÆm sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours.ö @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 heard ô@CAPS5 turns out @CAPS2 cannot get the part until tomorrow morning.ö @CAPS6 a big ôughhhö swept accrcoss the terminal. But luckily, @CAPS2 received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @CAPS2 all had patience, so @CAPS2 got through @CAPS5."
