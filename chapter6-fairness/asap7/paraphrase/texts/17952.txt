"That is the time I was to be patient.  Hope you enjoyed I am not a very patient person very rarely have I been patient. But, there is sometimes I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade my whole day was full of patience. That day I was getting picked up early. I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a good @ORGANIZATION1. When it was getting close to the end of the day the speaker in my classroom went ô@CAPS1ö then the lady and I had ?????????? for an early ?? mission I had been waiting for the moment! After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too! Then we went to there house got ready and we were off to a day we had all been waiting forà."
