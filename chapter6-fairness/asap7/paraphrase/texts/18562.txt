"?? It was a normal old boring day in the @DATE1 but I had just got a call from my sister in law. She literally just called me and asked if I wanted to go to cedar point the next day. I was astonished! I didn∆t know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding around but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. ??? When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so greatful I could not fall asleep. I ended waking up at @NUM1 am and I was not to fond of that but it was totaly worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and ??? the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Half way into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. I∆ve wanted to ride that one for ever. I was ??. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like ? hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law @PERSON1 was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think that∆s why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day hind of sucked it was still our all a great time!"
