"One day, me and my parents went fishing. Our fish under was going off like crazy but know fish were biling . @CAPS5 got the point (in a short time I might add) where our dog would back like crazy wherever we started to real in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited, and waited, and waited, but still nothing came. Every once in a while weÆd have to move again because of the current .After weÆd  been sitting there for house on end .I felt something  on my line. I thought  at first I was snagged on a rock, @CAPS1 I started to reel in, the line came a little, @CAPS1 I reeled some more, I thought @CAPS5 felt like a fish pulling on my line, @CAPS1 I called out , ô@CAPS3 ,dad, I think t have a fish !ö. @CAPS1 my dad told me @CAPS4 to do. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, ô@CAPS4 kind is @CAPS5? He said, ô@CAPS5Æs a walleye.ö I didnÆt know @CAPS4 to say. My first walleye! And dad even said @CAPS5 was big enough to @CAPS6! @CAPS1, then we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner."
