When I was in fourth grade and I was going to a concert and I had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long line to get in. While I was in line I started talking to my friends we played games and walked a few steps up every a minutes. I sat there and walked up with my mom and sat down again and it was just seemed like the line wasn∆t moving at all! Finally we got up to the front and me and my friends were so excited. Being patient payed off because if I would have bothered my mom too much she might have gotten mat at me. I had a lot of fun after I got into then concert. That was a time that I was patient.
