"ô@CAPS1ö I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldnÆt land it. My gymnasticsÆ coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he seeÆs me he says ômy baby!ö and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesnÆt. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. ô@CAPS1ö I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic ôtry againö, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didnÆt stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1."
