"Fishing is a great sports, but it takes a lot patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about @NUM1 miles from my home. I had loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasn∆t easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient accomplishing what I did took every oune of patience I had. When my uncle visits from @LOCATION1 he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a differently. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that  I should bring a friend. So if I get boared, I would someone to talk to.The patience started when we were about half way there and @CAPS1 ! We hit a fence. The car had broken down so we called a land break.The wait was about @NUM2 hours, @NUM3 min and my friend asked. So are and my friend sucked .We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way .Once we got there, we had two problem to fix, and we had no bait. We found a nice spot at the other side of the lake. We had to sea venge for some baits, which took about @NUM4 hours for enough baits.We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, sat the chairs, cast, and waited.There was no way to make fishing faster so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end my uncle, my friend ,and I caught @NUM5 fish ! We had eat three for lunch and went home with @NUM6 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened but we went fishing , relaxed, and brough a couple of meals. Thats why I have fishing because it requires patience."
