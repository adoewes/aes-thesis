"When ll was going to @LOCATION1 with my family I had to be patient. Our flight left at @TIME1 am so we were there at @NUM1. We waited for two hours. Nobody complained because we each had something to do. Me and @PERSON1 were playing video games, and my mom was reading ,When we finnaly got on the plane it took three hours to get to @LOCATION1 and no one complained then either. So this is the story of the time when nobody complaind for five hours!"
