"I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it wast the first week of football. We went town to subway before the game and got a cub. I was the first one in line but then I was folowed by other people olny one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers and great frech spinach.   It rearned something in that line being patient realy pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been @NUM1 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first games we played starta we tied it though but that was still a great day!"
