"One day when I was buying a dirt bike helmet online it said three day shipping and to me it wasn∆t very long. When the third day came and I was waiting on my porch for my helmet to come, my mom broke the news to me that my helmet got stuck in @LOCATION1 and it wouldn∆t be here until next week. after she told me I figured that did just have to be patient, as for the next week I just went to work with my dad. after my week was up, and I was sitting on my porch waiting and I almost fell asleep when a @ORGANIZATION1 truck came and gave me my brand new helmet."
