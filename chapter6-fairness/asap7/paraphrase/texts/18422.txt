"One day I had to go to the doctors office to get shots. When we got into the doctors office I had to wait in some uncomfortable chairs, with my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I didn∆t know how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience, I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldn∆t take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldn∆t take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didn∆t let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said Ù@CAPS1,ˆ and I was releved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didn∆t know was that I was going getin horrible pain for a few days."
