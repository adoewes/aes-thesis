"One time when I was patient was when I was in the end of the year in fourth grade and IÆd just signed up for football. I had @DATE1 wait from @DATE1. When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football started. @DATE1 passed by and it was @DATE2. In @DATE2 I show cows so that made @DATE2 zip by really fast. Finally it was @DATE1. I only had @DATE1 wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came fast. Then it was time @DATE1 go. I liked football that year and I have did football ever since.It took patience @DATE1 wait for football. Two months @MONTH1 not seem long, but for a ten year old it is hard @DATE1 wait that long."
