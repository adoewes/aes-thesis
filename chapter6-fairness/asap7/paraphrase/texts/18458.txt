"I remember the time I got my new puppy we had to be patient. We had to be patient because, he wasn∆t fully paddy trained yet and he was crazy. My dog is @CAPS1 and they are known for herding cows .So whenever we used to go outside he would bite our shoes. I don∆t know  why it would try to move us but it did .We had to be very patient when we trained him, it took until he was @NUM1 and a half years out to figure out that he wasn∆t supposed to do that  but on (my dog) is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for @CAPS2 dop to brave his hobbies, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient."
