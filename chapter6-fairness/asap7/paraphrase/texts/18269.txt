"My dad is a very patient person. He∆s known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lense for it. Because he was patient. My mom is very patient. My mom is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. I∆m proud to have such patient parent. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patient is."
