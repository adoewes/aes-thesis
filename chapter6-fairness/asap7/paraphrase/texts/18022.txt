"Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didnÆt. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, ô@CAPS1 do you want!ö @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter @CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @MONTH1 not be an expert @CAPS2 he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way."
