One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first nascar race. I had to be patient because there wer a lot of people there on I didn`t want to get last. An I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats. Second- we finally got our seats an I had to sit by this scary person he was weird so the race was beginning an you could tell because the racers were getting into there cars. The jets went over us and the @ORGANIZATION1 was going. Then the racers were off to race. Finally the race a starts on my favorite racer is in the lead (@PERSON1). The cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake. It was a fun exsperense but you had stay close is listen and be patient.
