"I want to go see a movie. There are no movies here at home I want to see. ô@CAPS1 dad can I go to the movies with someone?ö I asked. ô@CAPS2!.ö @CAPS3 answered. I looked up what movies were in and their was a pretty good selection. I pick the movie I wanted to see. Then I realize I need someone to go with me. I called up my friend @CAPS4 and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I wanted to see. Ended up she wanted to see it to so, she said yes. After that I got something to eat and relaxed. All over a sudden, it time to leave. I was running behind. I ready really quickly and went and picked up @CAPS4. Unlike me she was calm and patient. In her place I wouldnÆt have been. ThatÆs one of the reason why I like @CAPS4 as a friend."
