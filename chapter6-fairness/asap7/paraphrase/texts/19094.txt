"When I had to go to the doctor. I had thought that I would be in front. It was over @NUM1 people there in line when we got there more people was still coming. I had to get my shots. So we had to wait patiently. But my mom could not wait because it was so many people there in front of use. So I fell asleep. She was still walking around. So wen I woke up five people had already gone by. She still could not be patient, still walking around making me nervous then another @NUM2 went by its going really really slow. Then she finally cooled down. She was so patient because they said they was going to put her out. I have never seen her so patient it was no believable."
