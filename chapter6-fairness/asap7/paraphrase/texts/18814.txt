"What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tryed everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didn∆t work. My mom says I have to be @NUM1 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and she∆ll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place."
