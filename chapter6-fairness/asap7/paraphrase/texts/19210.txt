"I remember a time when I was patient. It was at my cusins house. It was very boring though. I was also sad and lonly, at thetime . so I am going to tell you. It was not long ago ,I was at my cusins house .Everyone except me .There were not enough four whielers ,so I was the only one left out .I felt so lonly .I couldnÆt believe how I was bored I was .All I could do was woch with envy .Everyone was having fun except for me .Everyone was screaming with joy and lafing intill they would cry because they were having so much fun .Then my dad ???a corner of cunies for me .I smile to try to look like I am having fun then  he asks me if I want to go I say yes ! So I I hop on the four where there was like no tomorrow .I knew it can just a little and main thank you to my dad , and take off .I could not imagen how much fun this was .I felt the breeze hit my face ,my shirt flappin on my back it was amazing .ö I wish this day would neve end ô I said screaming with joy .I had a lot of fun that day .I never had that much fun in my life .A lot can happen when you are patient .Even though I was bord at the beginning it was worth it in the end that was a time I was patient ."
