One day me and my friend @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 to alabama. It was the most boring thing @CAPS3! Imagine just driving in a car for @NUM1 hours just driving and stopping to use the bathroom. And to make the matters worse I had the smallest bladder there wich as I can imagine @CAPS4! But we did get to count waffle haoes because the farther south you go the more people like waffles. I∆m not kidding there was at least one waffle ???. And a kind of ??? was we weren∆t just going to alabama  we were going to the @CAPS5 of alabama. So when we finally ??? ??? still had to wait @NUM2 more hours. But when we finaly got there we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from experience ??? rides don∆t bother us??? ???.
