"One person I know was very patient one time I was associating with them. That one person was waiting for a call or e-mail that was promised to happen. The call or e-mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state. The person who was calling or e-mailing the person I was with was coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team. That is one time my brother was patient."
