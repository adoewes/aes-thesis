"A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go but she wasn∆t ready. She had to get her hair done and some clothes on. I waited patiently and didn∆t say nothing. I didn∆t want to but I did. I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go so I waited on her. I walked out the door quietly then my sister yelled I want to go wait. I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes, so she went upstairs and found some. She put her clothes on then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in the corner. So we were about to walk out and I said girl what∆s wrong with your har suprised. She felt her head and said o I forgot. So we went back in the house and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail and it wouldn∆t fit. So I let her do something and she couldn∆t. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went outside. That∆s a time when I waited paintently on my sister."
