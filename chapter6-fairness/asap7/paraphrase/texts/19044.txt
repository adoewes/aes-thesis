Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that∆s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that∆s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don∆t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn∆t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.
