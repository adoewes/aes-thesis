"There once was a time when someone I knew was patient. I was a cold @DATE1 day and I was at school. My teacher was very sick so we had a substitute. He was a very mean substitute. All of a sudden a kid started breathing heavy. He needed his inhaler. I told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no. the person next to me said the say thing, but she was patient and said ôokayö @CAPS1 the sub let the kid go. That was time a person I know was patient."
