One rainy day my dad's leg was brothering him. He took medican but that didn't work so we took him to the hospitle in coro. They looked at his leg and they told us we had to the hospitel in covent hospitle in @LOCATION1 so we got on our way to @LOCATION1. When we got to the hospitle these was like @NUM1 people in the wating room. My dad had patience to wait. When we had to go in the room. My dad had to get x-rays. He was also had enough patience to wait to see what was wrong. When he found out what was wrong. He had to wait even longer to see if he had to get surgey on his legs well after he had all the patience he had to go through surgey. He had enough patience to go through surgey. It is a good thing my dad had all the patience because his legs are all better I didn't think my dad had enough patience.
