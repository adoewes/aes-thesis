"Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to @CAPS1 point. When we went to @CAPS1 point we all were ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop ûthe wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the people started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good every thing worked out intil we got to the bumper cars."
