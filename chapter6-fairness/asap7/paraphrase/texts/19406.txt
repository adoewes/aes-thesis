My momÆs in the hospital! My mom was in the hospital! She was getting a life-threting surgery. This is a story of a time I was of a time I was patient. My mom didnÆt feel good for two years. And when she whent to the doctors for a ôcheak-upö it turned out she had heart disease @NUM1 main artary block ages. So I had to wait while she was getting  ôprepedö. It took two hours which felt like forever! Then I got to see her for five minutes then she had to be taken to the surgery room. The surgery took five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school. I did my homework and read magizens. I was very worried about my mom. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait till the next day. That was the time I had patients and it payed off.
