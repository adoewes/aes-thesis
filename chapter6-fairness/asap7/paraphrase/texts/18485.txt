"Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me IÆm not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient."
