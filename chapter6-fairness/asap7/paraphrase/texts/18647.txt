"When most people think of patience they think of waiting. But that∆s only half of it. Patience is waiting with out complaining, like when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five hour drive. I know that doesn∆t seem like a lot but I @CAPS1 corridor. I just @CAPS1 them pure and simple. But me and my brother didn∆t complain, mainly because the knight before our mom said two complained well sit with her in the hotel room the whole time. Isnt that scary,ˆ so we finally go there .The week was fun, we ate good food played sweet games and wen∆t to an awsome  museum. But on the ride back it was another trial of patience, even more so because we got in an accident."
