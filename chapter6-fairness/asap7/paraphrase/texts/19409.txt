A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the @CAPS1 before a lot of people and was drawing for the next @NUM1 minutes. I was patient throuout this time because if wasn∆t I might∆ve been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker board. It took the entire time and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.
