"I was patient in a plane ride going to @LOCATION1. All I did was stare at towers and buildings as I possed exit them. I was also patient when my little brother. Much got a fly shot and I had to wait in the lobby. The biggets time IÆve ever been patient was with my brother and him going through my patient, breaking all my stuff, biting me with his toys and his constant whining or crying over stuff that he wants."
