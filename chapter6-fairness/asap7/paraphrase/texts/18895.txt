"Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say ÙPatience is vertile.ˆ @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o∆clock, he will be there by seven o∆clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o∆clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and ÙPatience.ˆ"
