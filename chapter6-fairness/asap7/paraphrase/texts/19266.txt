"Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I∆m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I∆m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don∆t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn∆t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself Ùbe patientˆ over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn∆t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me Ù@CAPS2!ˆ @CAPS3 wouldn∆t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That∆s a time I∆ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That∆s how I was patient, and I∆m glad I was patient with my legs. I∆m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!"
