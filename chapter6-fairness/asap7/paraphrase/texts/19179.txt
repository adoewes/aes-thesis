"I remember I had to use @CAPS10 sisters old phone. The @CAPS1 pearl. @CAPS2 was really slow @CAPS2 dropped calls,and I was @CAPS3 horrible. @CAPS10 birthday was coming up, and I reall needed a haw one. and I asked @CAPS10 mom @CAPS4 I was going to get one for @CAPS10 birthday. She said ô@CAPS5. Be paitent,ö And  I really wanted to know so I kept asking her, and she said probably not. But I didnÆt give up. I  was really patient until @CAPS10 birthday. When I woke up, I saw presents on the kitchen table! @CAPS10 family watched me open them. When I had one left, I opend @CAPS2. Iwas a huge box! and I opend  @CAPS2 to find another box. and another  and another,  and another. Finally @CAPS2 was at the smallest one. I pened @CAPS2 and the side, of the box said, iphone on @CAPS2 !! I got an iphone @NUM1! I was so happy! ô@CAPS9 what you get for being patient.ö @CAPS10 mom said with a smile."
