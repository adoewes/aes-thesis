"We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well , yesterday, I was very patient my sister, @PERSON2 throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don∆t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here∆s the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn∆t let @PERSON2 go up to cleanˆ  it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, she∆s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her. Ùfriendˆ @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1∆s  text messages. I∆ll admit @PERSON1 wasn∆t being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We weren∆t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. I∆m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!"
