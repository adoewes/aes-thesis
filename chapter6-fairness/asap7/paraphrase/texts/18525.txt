"One time when I was patient was when we were flying to @LOCATION1. We were in @LOCATION2 waiting. God I thought how long can this take. But evenaly the plane came. Once on I thought ok this is the last plane we have to take today. But then the pilot said it was to be a @NUM1 @NUM2 flight. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I had my I-pod, a book, and the @CAPS1 in front of me. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed a hour so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That took off another two hours. By then I was starting to get bored. I decied I would read. But after an hour and û a û half I finished the book. Then my I-pod come out. I listened to music until lunch came a hour later. After eating lunch which took @NUM3 minutes I decided to watch another movie. I watched @CAPS4 @CAPS5 which killed off enough @NUM4 hours. Then with only @NUM4 hours left I wanted to watch season @NUM6 of the office. Then when there was only @NUM7 minutes left when they cut everything down I watched us land in @LOCATION1. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it."
