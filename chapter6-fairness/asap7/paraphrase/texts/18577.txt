"My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, ô@CAPS1Æs one momö ôsweet,ö she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie ô@CAPS2 @CAPS3ö I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so exided, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience."
