"Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patience because my little cousin who live in @LOCATION1 had a pisered   since birth. It takes her a little longer to ge things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little would but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with truninig wheels but she tryed and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So I∆m taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. She∆s improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really don∆t yell at her cause shes very emotional and sencitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience.  So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patience and she will @CAPS1."
