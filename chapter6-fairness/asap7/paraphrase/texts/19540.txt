"When my mom, @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was really fun. @CAPS1 because I wanted a lot of stuff that my family couldn∆t afford, my mom was very patient. I guess she∆s just naturaly patient. I just don∆t know how she does it. Anyway, throughout the entire store, it∆s pretty big. It∆s two stories tall! My mom a little angry with me because I kept on getting mad at her. @CAPS1 even though she got really angry with me, she tried to do her best to not show how angry she was in the store @CAPS1 by the time we got home I was so tired, I could∆ve slept for a whole two to three days! We got everything that we needed that night when we went to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day we had to put up our night stands. @CAPS1 I really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed. @CAPS1 my mom said that he might not get to it that day. I was almost literally hourding my dad to put our bed. @CAPS1 when the time came, I was fed @CAPS1 my mom was mad at me cause I wanted to sleep in my bed that night."
