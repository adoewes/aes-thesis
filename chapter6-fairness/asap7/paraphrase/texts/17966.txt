"One time when my family went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, we had to wait in line for the one roller causter I sayed witch one it was. Well I wasn∆t as patient as my sister, but I was pretty patient. After the ride I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere. Well there are many other times I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my @CAPS2.  She had just gotten her @CAPS2 touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my @CAPS2 too. Well I said yes. Even though I know I can∆t spend a day without using or just looking at my @CAPS2. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the composer was taking forever and her infer were on it like forever."
