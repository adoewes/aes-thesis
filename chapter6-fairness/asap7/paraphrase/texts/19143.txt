Being patient is waiting your turn in line and @CAPS3 cuting you should wait because cuting in line is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and  @CAPS1 disrespectful. and you will have no friends. Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being respectful when you don∆t wait your turn. @CAPS1 when you to do something which your mom and dad are speaking to another adult @CAPS1 rouged to rush things when other people don∆t want to do something with you. Or nagging to leave somewhere like a aunts or uncles house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when you don∆t wait. Be respectful and wait it∆s a better way to make friends. And if someone is @CAPS3 being respectful to you tell them to be. And then walk away and say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to @CAPS3 wait and be patient. Grrr.
