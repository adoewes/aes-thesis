"Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have short attention spans.  Patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that goes, patience is a virtue. Many have heard of that. Patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around. Patience isn∆t pacing back and forth. Being patient in problems is fine."
