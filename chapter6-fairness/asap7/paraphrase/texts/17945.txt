"A @DATE2 ago my @CAPS1 was brought into the @ORGANIZATION1 because of her incision from a previous operation panste open. Because of @DATE2 physical coller coaster, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her. Now I'm back and trying to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until and the time catch up in their class I think I'll make it."
