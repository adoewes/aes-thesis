"It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and we were up @ORGANIZATION1. We all wanted to go on the boat and go tubeing. We vent cared out to the boat and go all ready to go, we tried to start the boat but there was nothing. My @CAPS1 and cousin took the back of the seats off and peared in the back, there was boat-roads of water the birage pump had stopped working. My step-dad took a look at them and said that it was going to be re-wired. He had soon re-wired the boat and it sill hadnÆt worked all the kide were now getting antsy. Every adult said we needed to have patience. Everybody had now calmed down and walked away. Pretty soon we heard a boat start up that sounded like my @CAPS1Æs we ran down there with excitement and sure enough it was started we hoped in and there we went tubing down the river. Later that day my mom had said to me ôpatince is a virtue.ö"
