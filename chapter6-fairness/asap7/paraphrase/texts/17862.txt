Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn. Thats all I know about patients.
