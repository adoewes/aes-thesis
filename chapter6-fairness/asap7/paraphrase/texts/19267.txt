"A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and under standing. Sometimes when @CAPS6 in a bad mood I have @CAPS9 be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset it was buring @DATE1 vacation and my little sister @ORGANIZATION1 wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tank that rade by every twenty minuts frome the ice-cream shop which was about seven @CAPS9 ten block away. I was bund @CAPS3 in my blanket when she jumped @CAPS3 on @CAPS9 my bed. ô@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I want @CAPS9 go get ice-cream. @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!!!ö @CAPS5 I said in a mean voice. @ORGANIZATION1 you little hob ûgoblen get off my bed OR @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU @CAPS9 A @CAPS10!!! I was younger and in a terrible mood that crying is sound so sill and stuped. Tears came @CAPS9 her eyes and I didnÆt realize at that moment that she was little (fore years old) and didnÆt quite understand that I didnÆt fell good. I apologized and explained that I was sick. Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said ôI made mama make you some teaö. That was hart warming @CAPS9 me. After I drank it @ORGANIZATION1 asked if I felt better. I said a little then @ORGANIZATION1 got @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and new that she didnÆt fully understand yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 the ice-cream shop @CAPS9 get some ice-cream. @ORGANIZATION1 was happe ans that made me happe. I fell extremely proud that I was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 eve whe she got on me nerves. I know I was nÆt patient with @ORGANIZATION1 at the ôbeginningö but at the end I was."
