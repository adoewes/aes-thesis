Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes impatient @CAPS1 sometimes im not its better to be patient. My cousin is patient so when I tell her to wait and be patient she will wait as long as she want. My other causins tell me to be patient and I will just be waiting for a while and I ask then hurry and they tell me to learn to be patient. My cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient and we tRied. So now I can stay longer being patient.
