"Patient help you got through life. If You aren't patient then you won't know where to go next in the future. @CAPS4 uncle had to be patient face month. He was running a muck just @CAPS5 for a phone call. Finally someone yelled just be patient they will call. He bid  us being patient is the hardest thing he was to do. He was dined why they couldn't call the next day. He said ended up forgetting about  here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as he could be. @CAPS4 under was waiting for a patient ??? America's next  @CAPS1 @CAPS2. They add him they would call if he got in. They soon did  because the phone mug. A woman nicely said ""@MONTH1 I speak with @CAPS3 sanders please"" @CAPS4 uncle replied ""yes this is him! I  @CAPS5 for a month! @CAPS4 family kept telling me to be patient! So now I don't have up anymore!"" "" You are in! so keep on practicing! Someone else will call you with the details!"" "" @CAPS6 you so much!""then he hung upon the phone "" I'm in!"" @CAPS7 was the happiest days of our lives. @CAPS4 uncle with through a lot.
