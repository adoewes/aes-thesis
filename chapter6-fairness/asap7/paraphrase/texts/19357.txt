"Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boreing . There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didn∆t because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in flont of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait."
