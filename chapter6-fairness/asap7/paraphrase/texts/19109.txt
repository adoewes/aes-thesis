"One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait @NUM1 hours till we got to camp. I mostly slept and ate, we also watched movies on @PERSON1 @CAPS1 player. We finally got their, but I had to wait some  more for registration and I had to wait  till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin. Next we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friend, or last read in your cabin.  When the  bell rang we all went into the program center and waited  for chapel to end. We had a lot of patients by the end of the week. Ohh at lunch we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good. Finally, I had to wait @NUM1 hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience. (A whole lot of it)."
