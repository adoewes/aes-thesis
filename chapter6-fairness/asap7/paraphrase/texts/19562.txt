"I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. TheyÆre so boring. Especially the @CAPS18 long weddings that take like two hours of people  just standing there on the after doing  nothing  IÆm not the most patient person, so thatÆs probably why I hate long wedding. Now that is one long æstory about patience. ôDo we have to go?ö I moaned to @CAPS4 mother. ô@CAPS1 its @PERSON1Æs wedding and itÆs important.ö ô@CAPS2.ö I had to surrender as I put on @CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the wapin @LOCATION1. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam. ô@CAPS3 on!ö @CAPS4 sister yelled. I just kept quiet. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1. When we got a call from @CAPS4 grandma. ô@CAPS5?ö @CAPS4 mom answered. ô@CAPS7 are you? The ceremony just ended,ö  ô@CAPS8. ThatÆs bad. WeÆre in @LOCATION2, why? Has the reception @CAPS9 yet?ö  ô@CAPS10, but IÆm sure youÆll make it in time to be there,ö  ô@CAPS11. ThatÆs good. @CAPS12.ö ô@CAPS12.ö @CAPS13, as if on we, he reached the reception. I was so happy to be there even if I do hate weddings. ô@CAPS14 you have @CAPS16?ö @CAPS4 mom asked as we arrvied home. ô@CAPS16? I asked.ö @CAPS17, I guess I @CAPS14, even the car ride was kind of @CAPS16.ö  ô@CAPS18? You tend not to be the patient type.ö ô@CAPS1ö I said and I was proud."
