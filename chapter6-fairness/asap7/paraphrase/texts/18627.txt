One time when I was patient is when I was a little kid and my mom said we were going on a top to visit my cousins in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was just a little kid so I was very excited to take my first plane ride. When we finally got to @LOCATION1 I was so excited. I asked my mom when we got to the hotel can I go swimming. She told me to just be patient. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could be then I could∆t wait anymore. So I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something.
