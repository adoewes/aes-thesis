"Once before I went to @CAPS1 point with my friend @PERSON1. I was patient on the way there. I was patient in line to get inside. I was patient in line to get on the dragster. I was patient to go on all the rides. Once I had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart. I was patient waiting for my results. I am always patient. Well most of the time. Once I went to @LOCATION1, I was patient to go through security. I was patient on the plane waiting to get there. I was patient to get off. I was patient for my luggage. I have to go to school. I am patient waiting to  lunch. I am patient for school to be over. I am patient to wait till class is over. Like I said I am mostly patient."
