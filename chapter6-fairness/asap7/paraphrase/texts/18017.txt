"Being patient is sometimes hard but sometimes you don∆t care. There are many times I was patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or @NUM1 minutes. There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom danced me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little yearly. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they weren∆t. After waiting thirdy minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didn∆t have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When I was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, Ùit starts at @TIME1. So I have to leaveˆ. She kept asking me why I didn∆t call and I kept telling her I didn∆t have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humble to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I can∆t go an hour. Thats one of the horrible times I was patient."
