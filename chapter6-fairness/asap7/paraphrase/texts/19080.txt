"We∆ll I∆m patient and I∆m in the middle patience is all about waiting or juss sitting with someon you don∆t like. One time when I was little I was not very patient. My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say @NUM1. But when I got older I was more patient. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens. I love having someone to talk to but some times I can∆t talk to them because I∆m unpatient. My friends are really good about it first though some time they don∆t my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him I don∆t really talk to my dad though although I∆m unpatient I∆m really out going and funny. I have a lot of friends because I∆m outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because I∆m outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment. In conclusion I need more patience but patiuence is a thing I can defiatly work on."
