"Tic tak times tiking  I was patient one time it was in the doctors office my oppment was at two and I had to wait and wait and wait and wait I sat there until it was @NUM1 and they finnly called me in. Once again I had to wait and wait again. So I was trying so hard to be patient and trust me it is not easy for me at least because I can∆t even sit there for @NUM2 minitues and stay still I have to move aroud so it was hard to sit there  lisening to the sound tik tok for a while. And that was the time I was pacient it was hard to belive but I did it. The hardest part was when you here one off those tiker clocks go tik tok and I was stinn there for a while now you absolutely now that for some people incuding me. It is sometime hard for you to be pacient some times its ok to be pocient and sometimes its so hard to be pacit and sit there and oh absolutely noting, so that is my story arbout the time I was pacient and was not inpocit sitting there doning noting not conplaning  wating  to and @CAPS1 mazines."
