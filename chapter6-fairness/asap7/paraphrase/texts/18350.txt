Thompson volleyball playersaka @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lost our tournment. We went on @DATE1 at a @CAPS3 resturant. And you know @PERSON1. She had asked for some chopsticks and the @CAPS1 made us wait for @NUM1 minutes for chopsticks. So @CAPS4 a volley ball player asked and she gave everybody some but the adults! We had so much fun. I had asked for some napkins but we did not get none.I was really made at the waiter but I had fun and the other aris had fun!
