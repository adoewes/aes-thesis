"The first time I learned patience was when I was I my mom said she would by me a play @NUM1 I wanted it so bad but in, had to wanit to get it so I did and I waited and waited and waited then if figured it∆s a whole month that and nothing happend I just was so mad but I didn∆t do anything so we went to wal mart and she bought me a play @NUM1. I was in happy. Later I asked for an xbox (stirl seven) my mom said wait I waited for @NUM3 months but still nothing. @NUM4 months nothing, @NUM5 months nothing, I was just so angry but a whole year passed I got @NUM6. I was awsome I got my own room and @CAPS1. I got an xbox @NUM7 to being older is awesome."
