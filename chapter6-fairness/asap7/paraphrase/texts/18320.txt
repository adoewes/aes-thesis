"Patience when a person is patient the can wait a thousand years   for an answer. Or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. That is amazing. Patience is when the person is always their when you need help and he will give you patience by just around him. I think patience is calm, doesn∆t lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience"
