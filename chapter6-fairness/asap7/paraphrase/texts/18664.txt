"Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4Æt have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but hereÆs a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like thereÆs no tomorrow. To bad I couldnÆt play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..ö @CAPS1ö ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face. ô @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing ôhe added. ô@CAPS4Æt get to happy , thereÆs still plenty of time left.ö I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I æd loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, ôwho is the loser now, huh?ö wow all it took was patient, and hopeö I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate whatÆs happening around you, youÆll end up getting rewarded!."
