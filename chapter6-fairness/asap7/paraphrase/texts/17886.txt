When I was patient. I was patient once or twice. One time was when I had to use the phone but my mom was on it. So I waited an hour and a half to use the phone. Another time was when I wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 to get some pop. So I was patient while my mom got everybody ready to go to @ORGANIZATION1.
