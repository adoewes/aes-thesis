"A lime when I was patient was last year every day I had to be patient, because of my aunt. last year my aunt would pick me up in the back of the school someday I didn∆t know if she was picking me up, like this one time it was the first day of school and I didn∆t know what was happening. I didn∆t know who was going to pick me up. I didn∆t have a phone so I couldn∆t call mane. There I was waiting being patience at the school. As I was waiting I with my friend to his house, then I went back to the school and waited. For about @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes or what felt about an hour my aunt came and picked me up."
