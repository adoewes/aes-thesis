I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1 their was a @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @LOCATION1 was it went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready @NUM3 after @NUM4 and the line didnÆt even move. I was so mad. Every @NUM5 the line would scoot to a bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. @CAPS2 when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me a airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2 all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys as were next is. We went to???.  I ask him what I wanted and he said ôyouÆll shoot you eye out side.ö @CAPS2 when I got mad because it had to be so patient. That is the last time IÆm going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall.
