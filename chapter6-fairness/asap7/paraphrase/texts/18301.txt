My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. At first we went in and it it took a hour just for her to get in. and she finally did get in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people come in and then go out. I see about @NUM1 people do that. I sat and read magazines why I was waiting she finally came out. When she was the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day.
