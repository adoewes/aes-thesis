"Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so muc h.  About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I defien tly had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and ordered  my new boots. When they arrived, they were too  small so, we sent them back. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didn∆t come. I had to be patient. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship something,  I goes through fourteen day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom have gotten a new credit card that week.  Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But @CAPS1 the problem is fixed and I∆m glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 riding comfortably in my new riding boots."
