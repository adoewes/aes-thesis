Patience is a special skill for some people and some its very hard. When I was a little girl I was never had any patience and even now. I do not have any either but my friend was always patient for me yah she would tell me to hurry up or lll leave but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and jekc it to the pound that∆s what she would always do to. Patience I will probebly never lean till @CAPS1 like older but I know I will learn it someday. One time my friend waited for @NUM1 hours just to learn about history I would have never learned that my but then again she did get ??? ???? on her @CAPS2 homework. so her patience for that was like really cool and she told me that patience is a number one priority. his was one time my friend had patience.
