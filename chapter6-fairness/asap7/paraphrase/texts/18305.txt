I rember when I was at luck if steak house and the lady said we have to wait a half  hour before we sit down. I thought I was going to die but my mom said to be patient. So about twenty mituens left I was about to scearm but I sat on my chair waiting didn't say a word. But I waited excienley and bould out of my mind. Ten minuets left and I am about to explode I want to eat but I can't but I still didn't do anything did not talk ??? got the bathroom. @NUM1 left I am calming down and about ready to eat still didn't say anything or do any thing. The ??? can kuinly eat and cum so happy then we ordor is mitens later are food comes out and that was the most patient I have ever ben in my life.
