"I was patient when my dad said he would get me some @CAPS1. They were @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 the shoes caust @MONEY1. I asked a few times. He didn`t answer, so I knew what to do. I decided the dishes, clean my room. I waited the shoes so bad; I cleaned stuff that was already clean. After a month of the cleaning, I still didn`t get the shoes. That∆s how something went wrong. SCHOOL!!!!!!! I haven`t ben acting right in school. I got my stuff together. Then I got the @CAPS4."
