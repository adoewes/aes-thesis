"IÆm going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes agoà I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now donÆt get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, toàuh, I think itÆs to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I donÆt know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! ItÆs very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I canÆt help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a ôsniffö, ôsniffö, ôsnifföà ôsniffö, ôsnot. WeÆre not aloud to get up, so weÆre stuck ôsniffö, ôsniffö, snotö-ing  all hour long. When you weÆre a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, itÆs none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, thatÆs better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably donÆt have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying thisà writing about patience, but now, IÆm done. (yes!)"
