"One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in ann- @CAPS1  and the was a lot of traffic and me my sister and my brother were in the car (we ended up waiting for @NUM1 hours) I was really unhappy so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I know. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down. I found out I was late so we had to go back home and do it again tomorrow."
