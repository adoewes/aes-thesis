A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. ô@CAPS1Æs gonna be a long rideö I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasnÆt nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.
