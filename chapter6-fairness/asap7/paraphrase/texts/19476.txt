The one time I was patient is when my mom took me to go get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there the parking lot was full I mean cars was so close you could hardly get in and out without scratching someones car. My mom parked across the streets the streets. When we got in there it was at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 people it parked. People were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like dardine. It was hot and smelled like must. We picked a ticket with @NUM3 on and they were on @NUM4. We waited for two hours. My mum wanted to leave. When they got to our number I was sleep. Wile we was in there I lost ten pounds.
