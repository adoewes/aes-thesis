"I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while."
