"The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom don∆t have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you don∆t have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses!"
