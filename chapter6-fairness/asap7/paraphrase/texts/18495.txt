"It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at school so boring as usal and my @CAPS1 came in on cruches I freaked out and, ran over to her and she told me she broke her leg and that she wasn∆t allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was hard waiting a whole month to hangout with her but, her safety was more important than my amusement. It was @NUM1 weeks after my friend breaking her leg out, I was doin well of not bothering he so I was proud of myself, but I got to help her around school. It was a few more weeks later she was almost better so I was excited and went and bought her a gift. The next @DATE1 @PERSON1 was out of the crauches and, cast and back on her foot that∆s the story of the time I was patient."
