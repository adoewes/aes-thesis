"There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will intrest you most. Finaly we get to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we get there my first thought is ôparadiseö little did I know that there was the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides they were for every thing. In two days of fun it is already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. my mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave ôparadiseö. We left around @NUM2 thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up.ö @CAPS3 we are homeö. I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was @NUM5. @NUM6 longer then we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (dans it no video games). That is a time I displayed patcience."
