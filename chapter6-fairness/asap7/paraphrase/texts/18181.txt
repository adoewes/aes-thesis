"One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours and hours and hours then he said acler our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when is saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After I got to the top. I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like, a dead animal. After five minute I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stop I stoped. But I got seed in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend carte down we both lauphed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite."
