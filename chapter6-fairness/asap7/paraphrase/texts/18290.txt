A time I was patient was when my family and I went to west viragna. And we had to wake up early to get on the road show we would∆n have to go in traffic. Show are on the round and when we get they had a nice house. But we had to want in a long line just to get in a resturant . and it took them @NUM1 just to get us in. And we had a happy dinner. that a time when I was patient.
