"Have you ever been patient before? Well l have l was sitting there in a nice warm and cozy seat exhausted dozing off waiting for them to say the came @PERSON1. It kept going throught my mind @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened so l just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me reading an avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silence orthodonist office. I kept asking myself things like I wonder what their gonna do today, I wonder if I'll get my expander off or what about my top braces. Then l starting to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room. A girl walked out ""@CAPS1"" l was excited and nervous at the same time but l was proud because l had sat there the whole time patiently."
