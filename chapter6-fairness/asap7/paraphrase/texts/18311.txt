"This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I∆m empty on the inside, i goess. There∆s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He∆s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He∆s useless now, but I∆m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it∆s not just @CAPS2 who I∆m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he∆d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn∆t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He∆s gone hasn∆t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I∆m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I∆m still waiting for a hello."
