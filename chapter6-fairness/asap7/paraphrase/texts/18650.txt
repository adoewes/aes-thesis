"A time when I was patient, was when I went to @CAPS1 point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. We rode some rides, then @CAPS6 sister said ôcan we ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again?ö I replied ôsure, even though it was our fifth time riding the ride. @CAPS6 sister and I went and stood in  line for the ride. I said ôwe should ride front row.ö @CAPS4 said ôwe should.ö @CAPS5 we went to the front row and the line was packed. @CAPS5 we waited twenty minutes or @CAPS5 when someone threw up on another cart. The employies had to clean up the barf, which took another twenty minutes. @CAPS5 we kept waiting and waiting un till they let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed ôwho would barf on a ride like @CAPS7,ö @CAPS6 dad replied ôI donÆt know.ö @CAPS7 day is a day that I rember @CAPS6 patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasenÆt worth the wait. What was worth the wait is seeing the smile on @CAPS6 sisterÆs face and her laughing."
