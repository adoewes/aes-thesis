"I think that my coach is patient because there are @NUM1 girls she is watching . She has to teach us stuff that we don∆t know. Our coach has in teach us stuff like the @CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with the slower kids that cant ran as fast. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all and it for a little of her time , so she had to be patient."
