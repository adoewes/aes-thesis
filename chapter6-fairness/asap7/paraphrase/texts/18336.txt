"Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time but when your impatient, you want to overcome the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was @CAPS1 impatient. My brother @PERSON1 and I were waiting for a new video game to come out but it comes out in @NUM1 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, @NUM2. Then waited another day @NUM3. He wasted @NUM4 days waiting while I focused on school. His grade drope to a @CAPS2+ and now he∆s blaming @CAPS3! So I told him hard @NUM5sucsess. He tried harder @CAPS4- he was using his time on grades while his game he wants is @NUM6, he∆s a lot happier now that hes patient using time wisely while keeping himself occupied."
