"I am never patient. Weather its waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when im waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if im waiting for school to start. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls. ?? when they do call I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back til bed time so I will never have to clean my room."
