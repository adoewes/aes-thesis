"During the @DATE1 my family and I went to @LOCATION3 for a couple weeks. In the beginning of the second week I did something i have never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), dad,cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2∆s uncle (@CAPS1) and I were on our way to the boat. I was excited, this was my first time fishing in a ocean. A few hours past and we didn∆t catch anything,but we still waited while drinking coffe, telling  jokes, doing little  pranks like pulling  each others line to make them think we caught something. We left at @NUM1 am and now it was @NUM2 pm. We still didnt catch anything but dad and @CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just had to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling @CAPS1 helps her reach it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home  we told evryone what we caught,which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldnt last on that boat for an hour. So i was proud of how patient everyone was and i hope to do it again next time i go to @LOCATION2 with my family."
