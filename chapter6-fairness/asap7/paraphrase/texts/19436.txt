"Patience is useful in certain times like waiting for a blood test or to me your ??? again. In other times patience is usless as in the army, any army, you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy .Patience is mostly good because if you rush you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just something you enjoy."
