"It was @DATE1, @CAPS1 my friends were talking about how cool xbox was. They were saying how if you get xbox live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I had searched it up online. And it was voted to be a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now thats a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both and always say will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why don∆t you wait till @CAPS6. And once I went to my dad∆s house he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it can∆t I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited @NUM1 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my mom∆s house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I won∆t get it. And so @CAPS6 came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an xbox with my favorite game I was sooo happy. And know I know if you have pacience and you wait long enough you∆ll get what you want."
