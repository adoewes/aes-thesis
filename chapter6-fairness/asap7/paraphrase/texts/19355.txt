I waiting  I was looking forward staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. @CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.
