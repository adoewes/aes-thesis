"Sitting in the car waiting for @CAPS2 mom to get out of the house and into the car.When she got in the ca    we were off.On the way to the???  For the @CAPS1 party I got pretty bored after about a couple minutes,when got out of midland I thought  it would go by preety fast but I was wrong it was slower than ever.I was bored out of @CAPS2 mind and the thing s that made it worse was that @CAPS2 little sisters were screaming in the back.So  then we stoped at a gas station witch felt like forever.I preety  much never talked the whole way up there I was trying to be patient but I  couldnÆt take it.I manged to calm myself down after about an hour of the girls screaming.They finally fall asleep.I just sat there loking out the window when we where about forty-five  minutes away it felt like we have been driving for days.It was probly like @NUM1 minutes away when the girls finally wake up.They started screaming ôAre we there yetö@CAPS2 mom and dad just keep saying ô@CAPS3öWhen we pulled into the drive way it was probly the happiest thing that happened hat day.I thought I was preety patient on the way up there but on the way back I might just sleep.At the party I was  patient  until we could open the presents.I freacked  out.I hope next time none of that will happen."
