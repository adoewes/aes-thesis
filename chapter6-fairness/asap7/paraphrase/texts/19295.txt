"Patient is a very hard thing to do in life. It∆s one of those things that is so impossible for people to do some times, even for little kids. You can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting  their turn without complaining about it . Sometimes people don∆t like being patient I know I don∆t lik to a lot @CAPS1. People who are not patient tend to @MONTH1 be not ??? tuned others wait. But people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet don∆t talk very much even when they do talk they ??? talking when people inturupt them. And they defiantly don∆t yell as someone  out at all. It∆s a good thing to have patiencets because you will grow up with an ???
