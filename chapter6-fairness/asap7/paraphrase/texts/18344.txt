"This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was a two days before I had to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots, I never liked shots because they hurt and make you fill sleepy. I usally never have patient∆s but this time I did. I had one more day and then I will be at the doctor. I experience why people should have patient and it∆s easy to do. Today was my doctors appointment and I was scared. When I walked in the clinic I always fill sick and tired.  My mom will go sign my name in and I fill more sicker because I will worry about how many shots I will have to get. My doctor had call me and I was terrified my mom always told me that it don∆t hurt if  you don∆t look at it. So I went back to the doctor office and my doctor told me to get on the scale, I was really he gave me an hearing test and a eye test. I asked if I have to get any shots he said not yet but I might have to. When I got finish with my hearing test, I was finish and I was scared for nothing. When I got home I had learn two lessons one was not to worry about anything and I learn how to have patients. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor."
