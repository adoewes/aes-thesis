"About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 sun dusky, @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except driving four hours in car with older & younger siblings in the car. It was lould, there was crying, there was all of that annoying junk, but I was patient. When my family & I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded! Like jam pack crowded. My mom took little sister & brother on the kiddy rides & my dad took my brother and I. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line & relize their line was about half a mile long & there park was going to clothes soon. Twenty minutes later‡ I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter of a mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasn∆t worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family & we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the most sadest ride  move ever. So maybe next time I should be more patient."
