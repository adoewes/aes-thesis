"A time I was patient is now @DATE1. The reason is because I am waiting for @CAPS1 new phone. See in @DATE2, I spelled orange juices on @CAPS1 phone. Everybody would call me weired and responsible. At first @CAPS1 phone was fine and everything alright. Then one day @CAPS1 speaker stopped working. I could call anyone or  listen to music. @CAPS1 heart sank. I quickly ran to @CAPS1 dad and told him about @CAPS1 problem. He first lasted and shook his head. Then grabbed @CAPS1 phone to test it. After he disconnected it did not work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how did that happen. Now at the time I was so stunned,so i couldnÆt figure it. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from @CAPS1 dad. I told anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a why are you laughing dad. He said ôYou are going to have to wait until I get the money.ö @CAPS1 face was calm but here I am still waiting for the phone."
