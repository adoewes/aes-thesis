"ô@CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you ,ö @PERSON1 said in a frustrated undertone. @CAPS2 was suppose to @CAPS1 over to his house .@PERSON1 had just gotten a new trampoline and they were planning on oon bouncing all day after school .@PERSON1 was starting to get worried but he waited .Finally his mom came and told him that @CAPS2 wasnÆt coming. Thats when the phone rang .@PERSON1 answered it and heard @CAPS2 on the end. ô @CAPS5, @PERSON1,ö @CAPS2 croaked. He didnÆt sound well. ô@CAPS2,ö @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, ô@CAPS2 , @CAPS2 where are you.ö  ôIÆm at my house, get over here. @PERSON1Æs mom pulled up at @CAPS2Æs house and let him out. @PERSON1 didnÆt care about manners at this point,so he opened the door and marched to @CAPS2Æs room. @CAPS2 was laying in bed looking up the cicling with his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, then looked back at ceiling. @CAPS2 wasnÆt at school that day either. He went skiing up at his family cottage. I wasnÆt patient when I was in the air. I got crushed and none of it would have happened if I had waited.ö"
