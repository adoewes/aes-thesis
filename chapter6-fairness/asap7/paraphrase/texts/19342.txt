"Clunk! I @CAPS1 in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole ""look whose awake so my mom berked as annoying as possible. ""You slept for long was though him might sleep until school that back up. ""@CAPS2 are we"" asked in a dreary voice. ""ohio"" replied my mom's friend @PERSON1. We were going to @LOCATION1 with my mom @PERSON1 and me @CAPS3 @PERSON2 over spring break. We would be staying in the florid @CAPS4. While we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in @CAPS4. I was going to be a memorable trip, but I knew the car ride there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us @NUM1 or @NUM2 days to reach our destination. The @NUM3 day would be the hardest of there all. This was the day we would he driving through the mountains. I can usually pass the time when I am riding in the corners, the ?? the @CAPS5 ??. However when we reached the peak of the @NUM3 mountain, everything went hectic. First off, my @CAPS3 (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane close to the edges. Second, my @CAPS3 started grasping my arm like her life her depended on it. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started getting up! All of things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself.""I 'm going to go insane! Just make it stop. As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my @CAPS3's grasp on my arm was relieved and we were pulling into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountain I would have gone insane. I would be sitting in all asylum. I will always remember that ride through the mountains."
