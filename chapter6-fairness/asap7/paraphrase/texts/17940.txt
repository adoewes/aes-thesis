I am all way patient wen I hunt and fish. I always go hunting I find a spot and setor clmeit in a tree. I waet for along time for deer and trukey and @CAPS1. Some times you don∆t see anything at all. The key is get out early and be patient. The most of the time I usely see @NUM1 deer wen its deer sesson wen I go out . How I see them alot is being patient a lot.
