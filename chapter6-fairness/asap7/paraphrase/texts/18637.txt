"This is the time when I was patient. One @DATE1 day I was playing with my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game, I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my games were kinda old. My mum said ""@CAPS3 sweetie just be patient"" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine she got that to. So I just keep waiting and I was also patient. My dad came back from @LOCATION1, and I asked him. I said, ""dad can you get me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?"" ""@CAPS3 honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" ""ugh okay!"" I hollered to the next day my dad had already gotten what my brothe and sister wanted, and I was the only one who my dad and mom that never gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard just takes patience. Thats how patience helps you ecomplish what you want."
