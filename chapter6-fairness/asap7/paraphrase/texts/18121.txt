"I am never paitent, but which I am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I∆m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I∆m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because I∆m not moving at all. I get buggy when I∆m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can∆t be paitent very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantive."
