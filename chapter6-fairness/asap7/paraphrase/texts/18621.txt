One day my sister had a volley ball tournament. It lasts all day. I just got there the worst time and wary for ????????. I can∆t complain or I will get in trouble I just have to be patient. I am very patient now because she has a lot of tournaments. When there are finally over my mom usually ?? me for being  good the whole time. As you can see being patient is hard but it is a very important trait to have.
