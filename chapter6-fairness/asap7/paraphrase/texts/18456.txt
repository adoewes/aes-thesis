"Patients is about many things. First, there is diffrent ways to express patients. Second, people either have patients or they don∆t. I admit I am one of those people that don∆t have patients. My mom is always saying, Ù@CAPS1 your horses.ˆ @CAPS2 I know. I don∆t have patients so why does she have to tell me I don∆t? I don∆t have any patients in grocery shopping I can∆t wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just can∆t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don∆t complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well that talks about patients and how people deal, relate, and chill about it."
