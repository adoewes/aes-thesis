"Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn∆t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1∆s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1∆s uncle∆s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient."
