"In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt real sick, @CAPS1 I took a shower and put on my clothes. I told my dad ôcan I go to the doctor because I feel sick?ö??? @CAPS1 he said ôwe will leave @NUM1 amö and it was @NUM2 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were talking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and tried acting @CAPS1 beautiful. @CAPS1 I didnÆt. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was @NUM3 am and my dadÆs favorite music was on @CAPS1 we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was @NUM4 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get there turn until it was @NUM5 which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. @CAPS1 I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was @CAPS1 pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said ôAre you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you.ö @CAPS1 we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself ôI learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.ö"
