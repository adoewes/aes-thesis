"A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times but one I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school (I missed schoo) while waiting I did plenty of things. I played my xbox @NUM1 and I got on the computer. But while xbox I saw one of my friends come online. He lives in @CAPS1. Moures @CAPS2. After he got online we played most of day then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing was on so I got on the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, didn∆t work. After that I tried to play my xbox but after another hour (nowaround @TIME1) it got bored. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till he got online. We played all day till night"
