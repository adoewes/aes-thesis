It was cold fall afternoon. Meant my grandpa where out on a hunting trip. We had geneat in the mornig @CAPS1 nolvek. Little did I know what would happen that day. We got settled into ground blind at about @NUM1. From what we saw it would be a long afternoon. We sat there @NUM2 hours @CAPS1 it seemed like an eternity. We waited and waited @CAPS1 still no deer. All of a suddn my heart racer at the sight in the front of our blind. We had lured the biggest her I have ever seen. It was a monster sised deer. @NUM3. @NUM4 feet tall and a @NUM5. Rack. I loaded my @NUM6 special and shot it in the shoulder. I was so excited I almost screamed. As is any story there is a lesson. Some are respect  your elders. @CAPS1 mine is patience is rewarded. and as you can see I was rewarded.
