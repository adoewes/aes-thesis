"There haven∆t been many times were I was patient but I∆m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn∆t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn∆t care because it was my friend∆s and my favorite ride, it wasn∆t so bad because it∆s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I∆ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!"
