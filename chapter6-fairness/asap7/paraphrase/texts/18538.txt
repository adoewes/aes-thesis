"Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn∆t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it∆s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan∆t get things done. Most of my family and I don∆t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have."
