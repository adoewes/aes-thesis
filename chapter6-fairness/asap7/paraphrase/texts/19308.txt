"Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming and I was extremly happy. I would always backtrack of my days so I had a personal calendar for counting down to it. After that I made lots of birthday lists. I went to stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw this beautiful short that had a matching belt.  @NUM1 days before my birthday I would not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 and check out all the wonderful cakes. The day came and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. I conclude  ??? I was patient."
