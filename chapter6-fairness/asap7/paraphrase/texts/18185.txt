Last year I had to sell my cow because she was sick. I have bell weight in for eight months to get A new calf but I didn't them were I would get one untill I asked my uncle who cases @CAPS1's small cow breed witch nor mail costs @MONEY2 but he gave me a deal on her for @MONEY1. It took me eight month's to fined he. But daring those eight month's I got tenacious and I couldn't sleep very well at high that when I got her home I was happy I had found her when I did. I still wory about her at night because of the cougar that is rooming the cluntury side.
