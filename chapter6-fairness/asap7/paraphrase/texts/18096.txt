I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience I∆ve had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine o∆clock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn∆t even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that nigh we went home really hungry.
