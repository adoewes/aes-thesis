"Being Patient. Being patient has it's good & bad. I have had good things happen to me. I @CAPS1 I had to do was be patient. Here are some good things that happen to me. A time when I was patient was when I tryed out for the dance team at my dance studio. I was so nuervie l never tryed out for anything befor. I had to wait &wait & wait for my dance studio to call my mom. One day when I was at a friend house my mom called me and said ""@CAPS2 you have made the dance team."" I was so happy. I couldn't wait to learn a new dance. Then I could saw everyone at my dance compitions. It will be so much fun. Another time I was patient was when broke my arm. I had to be relly patient. I had to be so careful of my arm. I had it in a cast then I waited to get it off. Now I have no cast on. I was so patient that the doctor said that it was healing & I didn't need a cast any more. If you are patien better things will come."
