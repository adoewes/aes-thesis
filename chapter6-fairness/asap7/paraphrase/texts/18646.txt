Personally I didn't like math all that much so unfortunately l had to wait. @NUM1 more minutes and l was home free. The time had come and l was happy. @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 your folder away"" @CAPS2! I @CAPS1 it away faster than I can say supercal fraja list expeal & docinus. So then in his voice he said ""You @MONTH1 go to lunch"" I hurried and I was going to be the first one there I almost thought I wasn't patient enough but l was. I booked it there home free. When l relized a figure in front of me. ""no"" l said. I was defeated by a girl! I was devastaded that is my story and I'm stick to it."
