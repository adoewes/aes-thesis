"When I went to the @CAPS1 conly @ORGANIZATION2 for youth group at my church I took some o my friend. In the maze we had to go as a group of @CAPS2 & me, my dad, @PERSON1, & @CAPS3 went in one group @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 in the group be hind us. Half way thru the @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2 there was a guy casing us with a chain saw & then @PERSON1 smacked my glass of my face so we had to stop that @ORGANIZATION2 of the @ORGANIZATION2 so we could find them & just before we found them my friends in the @CAPS6 group came & had to wait @NUM1 minutes wich seemed long. So they didn∆t get chance to get chaced by the guy with the chainsaw."
