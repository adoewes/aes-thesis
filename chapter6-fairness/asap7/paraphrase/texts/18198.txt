"Being patient is hard and not all people are patient, but patience is an important thing to do. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like waiting in line is being patient. You have to be patient with people to, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient in @ORGANIZATION1 which was really hard to do. When I was really little mabey four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldnÆt go because I was to short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antcy. After a while I started asking ôWhen is the ride going to be over mamaö she kept responding ôI donÆt know, when ever @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off the ride.ö @CAPS2 I couldnÆt wait, but when my @CAPS1 and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said ôokö and thats when I got sad then she said to me ôbut because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothy.ö ôI love smoothysö I scream. Patience is important, because I was so patient my mom got me something I love. Patience ia a hard thing to do but once you got it, itÆs a good thing to do."
