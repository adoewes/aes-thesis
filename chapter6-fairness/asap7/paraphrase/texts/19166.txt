"When you hear the word patience what do you think of. I think about a person standing in line at a store when theres @NUM1 people standing in front of you. In @NUM2 grade my sister and I played the patient game. It was about who could go the longest without food and all you could drink is water and the winner gets a whole box of dunkin doughnuts to themselves. Day @NUM3 I had about @NUM4 bottles of water but my sister was still hanging in there. Day @NUM5 I had about @NUM6 bottles of water and all day my stomach groaned some with my sister. Day @NUM7 all the groaning and the growling my sister was hanging and so ??? in was ??? their  I drink water. Day @NUM8 I snapped and had so much food my whole fontry was gone, my sister @CAPS1 was cheering and she said ôdonÆt worry ill let you have one of my @NUM9 choclate doughnutsö and she kept her word. In my opinion that was patience."
