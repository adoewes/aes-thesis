"One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher my class a leaf project. We had to collect @NUM1 leaves to get @PERCENT1. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this to a leaf you will have to put the leaves in newspaper then put books on the newspaper so the water will come out of the leaves on to the newspaper. It takes a long time to do this process and sometimes you half to do this a couple times for each leaf. I had to be patient because the first due date was coming up, but mom said to form my project in the next due date. So since I was patient, my project got done before the second due date and got @NUM2 extra points. So when your patient you can get rewarded"
