"One time I got in trouble for getting a @CAPS1 on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went up stairs to read a book. A hour later I came down and asked. How long am I grounded? She said I donÆt know how meny times do I have to ask you to tell. Sow I was buging her all day. She said I am running out of patients. I said can you just tell me she said okay. She pulled out a sheet of papper. I said what is that? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times ôyikesö! My said twelve days and that is final, I said okay. I think I lerend a lesson today? DonÆt bug your mom all day and do better in school!"
