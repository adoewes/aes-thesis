"Patience is the key to life some say. I don∆t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things."
