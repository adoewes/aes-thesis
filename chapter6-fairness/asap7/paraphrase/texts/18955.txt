"I had patience when my dad din because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him, but after a while the doctor came and said that he went into a seizer and then a stroke. They @CAPS1-@CAPS2 him (mydad) and we waited about a good @NUM1 minutes and we used about @NUM2 boxes of tissues. The doctor said that ""we will keep him over night to observe him"" @CAPS3 the next day went to the hospital and after a white they had to pull the plug. I had patience in that store because I waited in the labb of the hospital, and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened and when they took the @CAPS1-@CAPS5 and lastly when they said the need to pull the plug on him. @CAPS3 that's my story about when I had patience."
