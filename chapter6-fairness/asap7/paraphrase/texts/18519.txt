"The best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 was over @NUM1 hours long wait. Bad news for me become I am definintaly not a patience person. Like this one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream. There was only two people in line but I didn∆t want to wait so I didn∆t want one anymore. That∆s how impatience I was, but riding the best ride in the world I was willing to wait. Two hours of waiting in line we seen a sign that said one hour from this @ORGANIZATION1. Very mad I kept saying to myself it∆s the best ride you can wait an hour longer so I did. When we got on the ride it was fun but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds longer"
