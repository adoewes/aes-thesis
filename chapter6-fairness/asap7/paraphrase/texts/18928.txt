When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1∆s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1∆s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn∆t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn∆t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn∆t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn∆t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it∆s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don∆t know if that will happen.
