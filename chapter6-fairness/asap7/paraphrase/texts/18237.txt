"When we drive to @CAPS1 I have to be patient. When we are in the car I really have to be patient because it takes @NUM1 hours plus the extra time we spend going to the restroom, out for lunch, plus we stay for the night. But when we are on the road it is so @CAPS2, That is how I need to be patient. I have to bring a car bag to entertain me. I contains a book, ped of paper. My dad∆s laptop also. A big factor is my ipod. Exposcally I don∆t like that my legs got all??? and the??? ???. ??? ??? hate that felling. But at the end result I love??? you just have to be patient enough to get there and the end factor is the best."
