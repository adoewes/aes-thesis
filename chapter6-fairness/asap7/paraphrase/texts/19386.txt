I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!
