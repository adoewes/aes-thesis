"I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many expierences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something she texts me saying, ô@CAPS1!ö or, ô@CAPS2 onnn!ö @CAPS3 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunatly, @PERSON1 wasnÆt mad! She was understanding and said that it was ok. Usually, she would say something like, ô@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?ö @CAPS5 time she didnÆt say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had expieriences with many patient people and @CAPS5 expierience turned out to be fun!"
