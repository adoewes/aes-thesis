"A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my present∆s there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the day∆s got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didn∆t even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didn∆t get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and app∆s and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. That∆s why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision that∆s the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but it∆s some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..I∆m happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. That∆s why??? can play it because I∆m saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one."
