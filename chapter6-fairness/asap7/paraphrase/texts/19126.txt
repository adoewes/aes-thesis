"One day I was going hunting and I was patiently waiting for my dad to get his clothes on. When he finally did we headed out to the woods. After that we got in a blind, as we patiently waited for fiftyen minutes. Just then a deer came in. It was a perfect doe. Finally the deer gets in front of the blind about @NUM1 or @CAPS1 and my dad quietly says ""wait for it to turn broadside."" @CAPS1 I waited until it turn and shoot the doe. Finally we get out and find my arrow but never found the deer and I had to have patient for next years hunt."
