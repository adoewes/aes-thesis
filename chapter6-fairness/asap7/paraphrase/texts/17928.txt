One day I went to a concert at @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a very long line. While I was in the line there was this girl who had no patient cause we had to wait in line for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours when that time past we all went to get our spots and before we had did that there was this long line again but even longer but it was ok cause I had patients. With all this patients it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctors office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in his waiting room. And also I went to my living room with my mom and she just started talking on the phone and she told me to hold on but my sister kept on interrupting her and I told her you need to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone so she ran up the stair and she said your stupid punk so I said I don∆t care.
