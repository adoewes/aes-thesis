"ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn∆t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn∆t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I∆m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn∆t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids but her self and @NUM2 of them is hises.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didn∆t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didn∆t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she∆s in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I can∆t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten."
