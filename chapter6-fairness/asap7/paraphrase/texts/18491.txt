"When they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food. Our time is way easier than in the old days, they had to work hard at everything what everything is given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren∆t to many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny @DATE1 @TIME1. I was starting quarterback and I scored @NUM1 touchdowns and I passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up @NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. I∆m not a very patient person so this was @CAPS1 hard for me. I hope I∆ll never have to do that again."
