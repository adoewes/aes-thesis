It was a time for me and my brother to visit all my friends, we were so excited ?? ?? me than an hour to get there. I was so patient because I knew if l wasn't my mom would not be in a happy mood. ""Are wether yet?"" my brother mouned. ""@CAPS1 my @CAPS2, @PERSON1 we just got in the car."" I said my brother has always been important, I of course didn't say a word on the way there and everything he said something the ride felt longer."
