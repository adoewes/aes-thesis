"I woke before school started getting ready, grabbed all my stuff and walked out. When I got to school I sttarted hanging out with my friends and having a good day so far. At around @NUM1, @NUM2 hour is over and we go to lunch. I wasn∆t hungry and I wanted to go with my friend @CAPS1 she wanted to eat so I waited for her and we went outside afterwards. When we go outside we like to do back walkovers,handstands,backbends,fronthandsprings, cartwheels and stuff like that. After the bell rang in @NUM3 hour it was recourse I wasn∆t feeling good, I was hungry. I just wanted to go home and grab something to eat but we still had to wait till recourse was over then we had to ride the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home I didn∆t feel good, my dad asked me whats the matter I told him I was hungery and it was around @NUM4 and he said we have to wait untill mom gets home my mom gets home at @TIME1. I had to wait and be patiant for @NUM5 hours and I realized its ok to wait because it was a delicouse dinner and if i would have ate something else before dinner i probly would not have aten any of my dinner and if I would have ate something else before dinner I probly would not have aten any of my dinner. And that was a story with @NUM6 examples of me having to be patient."
