"Are you good with being patient? Sometimes I am but sometimes @CAPS1 not @CAPS2 going to tell you a story when I was patient when @CAPS1 normally not patient in situations like this. I had want to school with my mom so she can take a test @CAPS4 drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting I was texting and on the internet, @CAPS4 my stomach started to rumble, I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I can get something to eat as I was texting I stopped and thought about what was I about to do. I knew @CAPS5 hard long she had studied for that test. I didn`t want her to get a bad grade so I just sat there. I texted people. People called me so my mind was off food. After my mom finished her test she came out the room. I asked her ô@CAPS5 did it go?ö she looked at me smiled and said ôI felt confident, but know @CAPS1 hungry I shouted out ôme toö we got in the car and went to subway. I had got the forest now meal. With cooking, chips, and a drink it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. @CAPS4 we went @ORGANIZATION1, charlete, @CAPS7, @PERSON1 and others places as well. After I thought about it I never want to do that again. I was starting and my but started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing to do never again will I do that. At least I had bounding rime with my mom. ThatÆs one bright side."
