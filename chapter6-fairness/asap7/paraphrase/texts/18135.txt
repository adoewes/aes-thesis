"Patient, that∆s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing."
