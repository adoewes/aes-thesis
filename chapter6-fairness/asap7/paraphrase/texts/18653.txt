"One hot @DATE1 day my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. There was a new ride open called shoot the rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was it said @NUM1 hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about @NUM2 outside, we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way threw the line when my nerves kicked in I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About @NUM3. Later we were @NUM4 people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another @NUM5. As time past we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but I∆m glad.  I didn∆t chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regret it."
