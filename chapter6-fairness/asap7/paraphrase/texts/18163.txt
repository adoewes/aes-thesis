"There∆s many times I∆ve been patient @CAPS1 this one time, my little sister kept buging me, and I didn∆t scream at her or hit her. She was asking me to turn on the music and I said Ùnoˆ, she through a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she get hit, in a nice and kind voice. And she stopped. And I told her to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was desterbing me. I didn∆t become a mean person at that point. Last but not least that was a time that I was a patient person."
