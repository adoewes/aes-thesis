"A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to florida. It took about one and a half days to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to @LOCATION2. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife and his four boy went also. They had rented a house for us to stay with them. On @DATE1 which was the after we got their we went to @LOCATION1 to see my grandpa∆s sister @PERSON2. That took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got lost. The last time we went to florida was to see my cousin @CAPS1 get @CAPS2. No, his little sister was getting @CAPS2 , I couldn∆t wait to see them. The wedding was @CAPS3 I couldn∆t understand it.So I waited for it to get over. After the wedding we went back to my aunt∆s house. On @DATE2 we went to the flea market and it was huge. It took us an hour to look at the whole thing. I wanted to leave at stand fifty-five but I had to by something for my mom and dad. So again I waited patiently for us to leave. On @DATE3 we left to go home. We got here around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. I was so tired I almost fell asleep on the floor. So the whole ride their and back I waited patiently."
