"A time when I was patient. Was when I went to the book story and I woned a book. I was at the book store and I wanted a book called tayler swift back at the @LOCATION1 as a school girl and my mom said if you are patient then yes, and I was so happy because she know I love tayler swift book and her life. As soon as I got it I stared reading it. My mom said thank you for being patient I was you welcome I said thank you for buying it. I have told my mom that if we could go to the book store and she said not today and I keep on asking and she said not and I keep on asking and she said maybe. So I was and the car listen to radio and we when to the mall and there was a book store in the mall and I ask if I could look around and my mom said yes and she said find the bok that you wonted I find it and she bote it. This is a time I was patient. One thing I learn is to be patient if you want something and dont keep asking."
