On the way   while we were on the highway, about @NUM1 yards ahead of us, two was nurchaged and bath pulled over. They were beside the? With anger. Soon after that the cops came. Keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this. The cops investigated everything and called in something. @NUM2 minutes later a truck came around the traffic jam and started fixing the road. I don∆t know why there was nothing to be fixed. Finally around and how later we were let past, and continued over ride to @PERSON1."
