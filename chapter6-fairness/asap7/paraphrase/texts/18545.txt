"My name is @PERSON1, I∆m in the @NUM1 grade. But the problem we have today is patience. One thing you have to know is that if have no kind of patience, you want get any where in life. Every where you go you need some patience. You will not have any friends when you do not be patient. Patience will grow you in life. Let∆s just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days. So when you do go you have to get your ticket number and sit, it might be for hours, but you cant just leave because if you do, you want get what you. Here∆s another example let∆s just say if you had to go to the doctor because your sick, you have to wait, you should because what if the doctor make you go pick up the medicine, @CAPS1 are some results about patience."
