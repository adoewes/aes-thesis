"Being patient means that you are understand and tolerant a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. IÆm writing about a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient. ô@CAPS1ö @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he was leaving to spend his whole @DATE1 in the upper pininusula of @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 were dating since the beginning of the year. She was sad @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year .She had been patient all @DATE1 @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally the first day of school came she skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called a way .Couple of confused weeks late she said to him are you jumping  me or ???He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer @CAPS4 never came. Finally she decided to jump him but, she never did. So @CAPS5 gabby and me did .@CAPS4 far her on the outside she was mad but on the inside she was probably screaming today she has ômovedö on and now is dating a boy named @PERSON2."
