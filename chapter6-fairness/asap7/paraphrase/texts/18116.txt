"It was a bright sunny day and there was a long line outside the airport. People were waiting for their flight to @LOCATION1. It has been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, but there was a young little boy in the group that didn∆t seem to complain, he was very patient. Now it has to be five hours, their flight has been delayed, the sun went down, and there was a riot going on, but still the little young boy was still waiting patiently. It has now been twelve hours, people begain to leave, it was midnight, and yet the boy was still waiting there and has not yet move. Now there was only fifteen people left, it was dusk, and yet the boy waited there patiently. There flight has arrived and only there was three people there. They went in the plane. The other people that left saw the plane ready to take off and ran towared it. But they were too late and the only people who made it to @LOCATION1 was the two girls and the patient boy. The end."
