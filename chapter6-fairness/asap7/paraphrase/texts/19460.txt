A time when I use patient was when I finished my book. We have these thing∆s called teacher talk∆s where you tell the teacher about your book what you finished. I finished @NUM1 books called ÙThe sisterhood of the traveling saint∆sˆ I finished the last two book∆s. I wrote my name on the board for teacher talk. The teacher kept picking other people. I had to wait untill I got called. Everyday I would go to @NUM2 and @NUM3 hour hoping I would be called. But everyday it wouldn∆t happen. I finish another book so I wrote my name again. But I still didn∆t get called. I put @PERSON1 @NUM4 witch means I finished @NUM5 books. Eventually @DATE1 my name got called. I ??? to the teacher with all @NUM5 books. I got to tell her about my books and I was very happy I got my named called.
