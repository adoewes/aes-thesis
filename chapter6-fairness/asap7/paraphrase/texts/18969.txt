"Patience. It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was at my sisterÆs house playing  wii with my niece, when my brother in law matt comes into the living room and says, ô@CAPS1 bored, lets do something today!ÆÆ @CAPS2 we all decided that we would go to michigans adventures for the day. My sister @PERSON1 told us to pack the coler with snacks and drinks and to put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to @CAPS3 to go to six flags and that @PERSON1, matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours i moaned ôare we there yet?ÆÆ ôno.ÆÆ said @PERSON1 ôwere lostö ôohö  I replyed. But I really didnÆt think about how were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thosand times before. For the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet. In other words @CAPS4 was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitment. I stretched and squinted from the sunÆs  raise when my eye adjusted to the light I looked around and realised that we were at six flags! When we got in the first ride we rode was the supeman on that ride you sit and things lock around your legs and stomache and i tilts you over @CAPS2 its like your flying we wanted to ride it @CAPS2 bad but the line was @NUM1 ? hours long. While we were standing in line we found things to do like swing and play on the metal railing, play I spy and all sorts of things and when we finally were on and off the ride I realized that it was really fun, and worth it and that i was patient and didnÆt complain."
