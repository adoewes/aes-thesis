"Every year I go to my dads. He lives in @LOCATION1 so we stop ta the border. The border takes @CAPS1! So my family has to be patient, with them. On our way @LOCATION1 one time the border was packed. Our family had to be patient, or there were going to be some argueing. With four kids it is bound to happen. After an hour every ones patients were running low, so my dad kept repeating keep patient, keep patient over and over. We finnaly past the boarder everyone cheerd. So keeping patience is not the easyiest thing to do. We all need to learn just a little more about how to keep it."
