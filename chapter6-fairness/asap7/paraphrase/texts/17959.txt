"Patient is very hard when your waiting for something you want. Very hard when your waiting in a line that is very loud or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait only two or three days. If your not a patient person that cant wait for the simplest thing that will only take a while then your a very impatient person that cant wait. If you are a impatient person then you are selfish, mad, and evidently not patient."
