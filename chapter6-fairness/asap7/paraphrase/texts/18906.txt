"My neighbor was very patient when he killed that @NUM1 point buck for the first time! He was??? and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer!. He said he`d never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighbors∆ face when he told me, I was so happy for him. If I had the money I would have got something for @NUM1-point buck. When I got to sec the head my jaw dropped it was the most beautiful deer I∆ve ever seen."
