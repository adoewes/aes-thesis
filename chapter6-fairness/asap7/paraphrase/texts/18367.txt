"One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. His keys were some were in my room so I looked every were. After twenty minutes went by I still could not find them but my dad was still patient: I deystroyed my room looking for his keys, they were not in my dresser, closset, bed, or on my floor. I just had them to unlock the car and now the keys are gone then when I went to tell my dad who was being so patient for a hour I fond them in my pocket."
