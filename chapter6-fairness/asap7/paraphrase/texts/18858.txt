"One time I was patient because, the teacher had to tell me something. So I wated by the door but then she had to go to the office so I had to wate. When the teacher came back she told me thanks for being patient. Patients really means you can wait. Some kids don∆t be patient they get so made for example, there was @NUM1 kids in one group we were playing a game and they would get so made because they didn∆t get called on a lol. But the game was radom you pick stick and who ever sticks it was went. So being patients mean you have to able to wait."
