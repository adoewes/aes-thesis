"One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened, out of nowhere a car drifts into his lane then @CAPS2. Since our truck didn∆t have air bags it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with air bags. About @NUM1 minutes later my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the seen of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to to get @CAPS1. I waited patiently and I was praying he was alright. And thankfully my prayers were answered.  He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to were truck was to get our belongings. And see what happened to the truck the damage on the truck was not nearly bad as what happened to the other drivers van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But I∆m glad I still have my brother."
