"I have a lot of patience for example one I really wanted to know @CAPS1 I made volleyball team, and I had patience, I did not complain. I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others. Once I had a test and really wanted to know when we were going to receive it, but I had patience. Others did not have Patience they kept asking what we are going to get @CAPS1 both were complaining they did not have Patience. Another example is we∆re going to go to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 and we still had planned the day I did not have ruler here that time, and it made it worse leaving the patience the more thinking about it and that made it work .Men @CAPS1 sometimes more  on and patient and sometimes not so much"
