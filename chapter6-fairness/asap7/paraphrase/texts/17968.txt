"ô@CAPS1ö @CAPS2 my teacher said ô@CAPS3 we are starting the meap test!ö ôuhhhö the @CAPS2 sighed exactly at the same time. After teache passed out our booklets we filled in information, wrote our names and begain. As the test dragged on I @CAPS4 @CAPS5 finished! But there were slow workers who were very slow. I was bored! Nothing to do but sit down. I wanted to complain but I decided not to for the sake of my @CAPS2, finally part @NUM1 was finished. ôTime for part @NUM2 @CAPS2!ö exlamed teacher. ôoh youÆve got to be kidding me I said to myself. Part @NUM2 was short, but it took one kid @NUM4 mins! At the end of the day teacher was very proud of me for being patient. Later that year my meap results came in and they were fantastic!"
