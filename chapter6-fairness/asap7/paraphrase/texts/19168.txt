"A time when I was patient was when my dad and I went to leslie, to go hunting we wake up @TIME1 @TIME3 and get there @TIME1 @TIME4. We staid there until @TIME1 then we left. When we were there my dad shot a doe @TIME1 @NUM1 in the merking. He short another doe @TIME1 about @NUM2 in the @TIME2, so we left with two big does in the back of my dads truck. That was a time that I was very patient."
