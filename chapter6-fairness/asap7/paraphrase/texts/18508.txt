"There was a person named @PERSON1. He wanted a video game for his @CAPS1- box @NUM1. But, his dad just got laid-off and his mom had a low-paying job. Since they had very little money, he couldn∆t buy the game. A few months later, his dad finally found a job at @CAPS2. But, @PERSON1 still didn∆t have enough money for the game. A few more months passed, @PERSON1 finally had enough for the game. His mom took him to the store to buy it. He was very excited. He ended up loving the game very much."
