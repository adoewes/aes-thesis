"In my thirteen years of expirience I have road many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster these is normally a two hour wait. In the @DATE1 @NUM1 I took my best friend @PERSON1 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" and we had just gotten in line for a ride called ""The @CAPS3."" When we got to the entrance @CAPS4 said a forty-five minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours. Finally the ride was up and running but @CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that ended @CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @CAPS4 didn't realy affect us. We finaly road that ride and was totaly worth @CAPS4. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down."
