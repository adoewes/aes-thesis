"Being patient requires a lot of tolerance. For most people @CAPS6's hard to be patient but sometimes @CAPS6 is very important. A few weeks ago my neighbor really needed a break from her @NUM1 year old daughter @CAPS1. I gladly offered to babysit because I love being with her. I definitely didn't know @CAPS2 I was in for. She came over at around noon and we played for hours. But then she got cranky. I gave her a snack but that didn't help. She start crying so bud I loud no idea @CAPS2 to do. My mom came rushing in the room in panic mode."" @CAPS2's going on? Is everything ok in here"" she asked. I told her that everythings fine but @CAPS1 is just really cranky. My mom replied ""let's take her to the park she will have fun there!"" I agreed and off we went. If noticed @CAPS1 likes to do things herself. She insisted on getting in her car seat done, getting on the swings and putting together puzzles. That requires a ton of patience because she takes forever. I love watching @CAPS1 but if I didn't have patient @CAPS6 would be extremely difficult."
