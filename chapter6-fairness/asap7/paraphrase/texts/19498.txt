"Patience, it∆s something that my family doesn∆t have. Here is the story. Wile am doing the dishes my little brother is crying cause my little sister @PERSON2 hit him. So sence @CAPS1 is crying (my little brother). @CAPS3 starts to cry (my little sister). So then my step dad is playing on his iphone. He is going to yell at @CAPS1 pretty soon. And what do you know he does. Okay you think it∆s going to get better? Nope wrong. I get @CAPS3 to stop crying. But @CAPS1 just won∆t so l call @PERSON2 in here and @CAPS1 got to hit her then my step dad starts to go crazy cause he is still crying now @PERSON2 is being a brat stomping of the stairs. When ??? got ??? calm down. Now just as l am about to go crazy @PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes  @CAPS1 down stairs to calm him down. Thank @CAPS7, for @ORGANIZATION1. Then I calm @CAPS3 back down. What a day well l guess my family does have patience well not my step dad."
