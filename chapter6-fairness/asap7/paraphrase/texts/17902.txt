"There are many times when l∆ve been patient but here are just a few. It was a late afternoon my family & I were supposed to go to a big function that day. Like always I didn∆t know what I was going to wear, about an hour later I found what I was going to wear. I went down stairs to the soon no one was ready & we only had @NUM1 1/@NUM1 an hour left. I was frustrated told everyone to go get ready, but nobody listened to me. But I didn∆t care so I went up to fore a shower right  when was as out to go in my mom come and told me I had to wait ??? She took a shower. Then one by one everyone took a shower except for me. I was loosing my patients. I still waited because I didn∆t want to start a commotion. Finally I went into take a shower. We were all dressed & ready to go. At the last minutes when we all got in the car, my sister for got her bag & jacket so we had to wait till she got it. We finally made it to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, a few exam pies of me showing patients is when I waited to take a or over when in waited for my sister to got her lay a jacket."
