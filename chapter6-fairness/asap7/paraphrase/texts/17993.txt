"My brothers checkup was today, why did I come? All I did was sit patiently for @NUM1, there was nothing I could do @CAPS1 I kept my cool. Waiting there in a dark room was hard, I picked up a near car magazine and started flipping through it, @CAPS1 the interesting thing was a article about a new @CAPS2 coming out. I read that in @NUM2 I went to the bathroom, and really soon was back in the wasteland of darkness. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple people. Five minutes passed and answer no I close my eyes and layed my head back so I waited and waited. Right when I was about bash my head on a brick wall my brother enters the room and says Ù That∆s it Ù.And then I got a text by two people, it would have been better while I was board out of my mind!"
