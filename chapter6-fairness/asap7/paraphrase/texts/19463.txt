"A time when I was being very patient was when I went to ô@CAPS1ö at ceider point.. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldnÆt go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called ôThe dead zoneö, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say ôwere going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesnÆt have any mechanical problems.ö ThatÆs when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called ôThe mauerieö. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I donÆt think so."
