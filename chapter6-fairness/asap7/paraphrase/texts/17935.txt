A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shoping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shoping it was boring but it was kind of full because some of clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the other. One store only had girl       clothes which I hated. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient my my asked me where to you want to go? I said to best buy I got a game it was colloge football oq. When you have patient's it can pay off in the end and always have patiens where ever you go or are always have patients.
