"I∆m always having to be patient. It∆s because I have an older brother that doesn∆t do what he is told. Let∆s say my dad tells him to clean the bath room, well it takes him ten minuts to get up, then I have to go when he∆s cleaning and he won∆t let me. So I∆m that∆s one of the reasons. Another is my older sister she∆s always on the phone so I barely ever get to use it. So I wait until my parents get home so they yell at he to get off, that∆s why I∆m very patient."
