Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So IÆm happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.
