"Melted @CAPS1 One day @CAPS13 sister and I have just woke up one bright @DATE1 @TIME1. @CAPS5 was at @CAPS13 door. The light shinned through @CAPS13 cartains and @CAPS13 covers. @CAPS5 pushed the door open just a crack and said, ô@CAPS2ö ô@CAPS3ö, I got up moaning ô@CAPS4 me up. IÆm sleeping.ö @CAPS5 helped me up and hugged me while I was searching, I went in to the living room. @CAPS5 were in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but @CAPS19 was aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the tv when I didnÆt know @CAPS13 mom was on the coach. ô@CAPS6, go put the clothes in the diverö, called ?? ô@CAPS7.K.ö I ??, ô(@CAPS8 want to come down stairs to.ö ô@CAPS9ö he exclaimed. ô@CAPS10Æ I thought in @CAPS13 head. We walked down stairs in the ??? to the laundry room when we finished putting the clothed in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said ôDo you smell that?ö @CAPS5 look frightened and said ô@CAPS9 IÆm cooking something. ô@CAPS13 eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened @CAPS19 and @CAPS14 pushed me out side hare coms. ô@CAPS10 air!ö we m joined. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire; we ran towards @CAPS17 still on the couch sleep. We shook her and shook her but @CAPS5 didnÆt wake up, so I said ôcover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!ö ô@CAPS16 wrong with yaÆll!ö @CAPS17 yelled. ôThe @CAPS1, fire, @CAPS18 @CAPS19!ö I screamed. @CAPS5 stood, we ran, @CAPS5 grabbed a cup of water and poured @CAPS19 on the @CAPS1. ôI need to teach you how to cook better or until you wonÆt set any thing on fire!ö I said."
