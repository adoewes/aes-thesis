"This year mom maryed my new step dad. I guess he wanted ous to Ùbond so we took up trap shooting. It pretty much the same thing as skeet shoot, well actually is the same. Anyway he used to be a cop and had a shotgun so we went out and tried it. It didn∆t work out. I missed every single bird I clay targets jet actped one. I only got one bb through the thing. But I was cool with it I new I was bad because it was the first time. So we tried the hit the thing died center. I feelt shown up. We left that day with only ten hits and a uncountable amout of missis. I was feteling pretty low. Within the next week we tried again. He lanched the bird and it almost like in slow motion I whated it ark. I followed it with the ball at the end of the gun an pulled the triserand I watched the bird explode. Haha, I fanily did it? We lanched another and I hit it I went @NUM1 in arrow! Amazing for someone who missed all about a few be for And that∆s how I was patient."
