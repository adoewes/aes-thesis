"I always have to be patient when I put way model airplanes together. Sometimes I have to ask my dad for help when putting together harder models. Like the @CAPS1- @DATE1 on the @NUM1 bombers. I also have to be patient when hunting for rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkey. If IÆm not patient I could mist a good shot or a good animal. I sometimes have to patient at school with @CAPS2 and other students."
