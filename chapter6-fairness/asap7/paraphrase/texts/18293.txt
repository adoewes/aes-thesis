"I am patient in a lot of stof, when I play I am patient. When I take a test I am patient. I am almost patient in everything. Lots of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer there not patient. They just want to take the ball and score. One time I was playing at the park with my friends I was playing soccer my friend told me to pass the ball. He was not patient at all that day."
