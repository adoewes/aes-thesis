"This @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 the part cucry one forgets is the @NUM1 hour plane ride. We were in a group of @NUM2 familis all my friends. When we become the plane we were an exited, @CAPS1 on gate were scattered all over. So I sat with my @NUM3 favorite friends in that trip. We were all loaded with as electicails the enemes. As we foot on I thought @CAPS3 was going to be a breeze, @CAPS1 thought wrong. At first @CAPS3 was fine we talkes and played games in our I pods and sort, @CAPS1 after like @NUM2 hours we started setting itchy and our I pods died. So then we decided to watch a movie as our mind dvd player. @CAPS3 was starling to irn low on battery and the plan was broken. The thing died and we still had like another @NUM2 hours and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat there was a tv so we forced @CAPS3 on, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 was one of @NUM6 of the???did not ???. We started to see really??? and @CAPS3 was getting late. We didn't know what to do @CAPS3 was hopeless .We had to sit and wait if out sit was a true talk of patience. We??? @NUM3 home??? @CAPS3 was the longest @NUM3 horrs ever. We did nothing. @CAPS1 as we wanted we bolted out of our seats and into the air read @CAPS3 was over. We didn't have to be patient no longer."
