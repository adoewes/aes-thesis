"One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, bother and I, in the waiting room / lobby. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before rushed to the time I was being patient."
