"At time I wsa very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used paintence, carefulness, and steady hand to finally succeed!"
