Patients in my way of saying is a person that waits awile if she needed to. The only reason im putting this in my own way is because know one is patient in my family. Pations is s person where if they were stuck in traffic then they∆ll be able to sit and wait or there∆s a really long wait or line. Or they∆ll be able to wait for something they need. Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That∆s what patients mean to me in my own way.
