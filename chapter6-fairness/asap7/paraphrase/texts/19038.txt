"The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right. I am being patient about waiting for @CAPS1. I∆m not a person who ??? to be patient. When I want something I were that second. Cristmas is my favorite holiday. There is so much good stuff about it. There are cokkies, family and present. There is always a problem and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily and if they don∆t wrap it very good I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged. Something also it seemes to be all holidays are like that. Well I guess we all have to be patient on something I∆m being patient on @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and flordia gators. Ficst @ORGANIZATION1 has got to get out of the @CAPS5 bold game thing."
