"One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. Ù@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?∆∆ whispered @PERSON1. Ù@CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain.∆∆ @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane∆s rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. Ù@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?∆∆ whispered @PERSON1. Ù@CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6∆s back turned.∆∆ @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. Ù@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased.∆∆ @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances."
