"A while ago when I went on a trip to cedar point in @LOCATION1, it was an hour and thirty @DATE1 drive to go there, the reason why we went was because of my dad work @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I kept out of the car with??? @NUM1, wait for my suaisn  family, waiting  was all I did until @DATE1 were burst out running into the parky my dad points out the height  limits (I was only @NUM2 and ô4.@NUM2öft tall @CAPS2 I wasnÆt tall enough for most of the, @CAPS4  rides ,my dad saw that I was tall enough for the @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We walk around looking for the ride and more importantly he line. So we finally??? the ride my attention was drawn from the ride to the  line ,my mouth practicely hit the ground with the expression  ô@CAPS7 luck getting to the that rideö, my father looked at me than my sister  ô where is mom and will?ö I pointed over by the faress whell being covard of course. So we just get in the line and sign, it was at least @NUM4 something degrees. we waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front, we got into the chair and a bar came over us, I remember one thing set a quarter on  your leg and gravity takes a hold of it . A minute @CAPS8 we are going down like a neteour the quarter doesnÆt float @CAPS9!  At that split second were on solid ground now the ride was not really worth the wait, but hey IÆm not a covard."
