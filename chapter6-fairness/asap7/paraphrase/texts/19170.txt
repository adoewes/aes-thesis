"Patience someone was patient with me when I did not understand something. Someone was a teacher. The teacher did not complain about helping me. Along with the students in the room. When the teacher was helping me they sat and quietly did there work. The teacher understand that I did not understand @CAPS1 to do the work. It was during math. We were tarning about positive and negitive  intergers. My question was, ''@CAPS1 do you order them from last to greatess''. She replied , ''I asy would you like me to show you?'' I said , ''@CAPS2 please''. So for about @NUM1 minutes she helped me. In that time my whole class sat and did there work. That is one time when people were patient with me."
