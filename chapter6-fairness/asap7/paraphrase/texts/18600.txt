"Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. ô@CAPS1 you can get it this time.ö I encouraged myself. I stored at the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap!  I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. ô@CAPS2 @CAPS3ö I think. ôYou got this!ö my entire team stared at me. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand. I will myself not even to look in the crowd. M y hand strikes the ball. It flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the  court. Since I was patient @NUM1 didnÆt give up, I achieved my goal. This taught me one thing. Patience brings victory."
