"Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousin∆s third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what they∆re doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousin∆s birthday party ˚ babysitting requires a lot of patience!"
