"I know a time when I was patient. My friend @PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant @NUM1. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got their. When he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do. AS the day progressed the sun was like a tanning booth. The grass was also as dry as cactus, but the day moved on. Finally when we went are own way. We knew we had patience."
