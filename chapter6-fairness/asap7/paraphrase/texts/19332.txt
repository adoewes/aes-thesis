The time I had @NUM1 be patient was when I was at my first foot ball game. I wanted to get in but I had to wait. I waited an hour to get in. The team was tied in the @NUM2 to @NUM2 and it was the @DATE1 and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player so he put me in I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball he tumlied and I ran for the touchdown. If I wouldn't have been patient I wouldn't have won the game cause the coach wouldn't have put me ind that was the time I was patient.
