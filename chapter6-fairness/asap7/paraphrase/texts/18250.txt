"It all started on a cold and snowy @DATE1, there was only two days till @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of the rainbows. Also people are very happy around this time of year. I always become impatient waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. This year I was going to be patient. @CAPS4 I started being patient by going with my mom to go buy new light @CAPS1 tree, and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store. @CAPS4 when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line. My mom told me too be patient, @CAPS4 I did. When we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow up @LOCATION1 which was taking a very long time, but I had to be patient. Finally it @CAPS6 to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said as patient can. ''@CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies were eventually all fasted with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up we were ready for @CAPS1. ''@CAPS6 on @CAPS1,'' I said to myself. I need to be patient or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS10 everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got their presents I bought them. As everyone left I walked to my room not remembering that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: @CAPS13 I was patient and it payed off."
