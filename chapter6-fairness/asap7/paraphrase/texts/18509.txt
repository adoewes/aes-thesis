"Have you ever heard your mom or dad say patience is a virtue. Well I∆ve heard it many times in my house actually too many times. Patience is a something that means you have to wait like when you wanna go see a new movie on opening night, you might have to wait in a big line cause it∆s a new movie. So your gonna have wait with patience!"
