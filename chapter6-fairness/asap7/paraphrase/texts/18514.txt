"I was at the @NUM1 fair with my friends. There was a ride called the freak-out that we really wanted to go on. The line was to long so we decided to go on some other rides. We looked over at the line and all it was doing was getting longer. We decided to go get in line anyway. It felt like we were moving an inch every @NUM2 minutes, I had to be very patient. On the inside I was ready to go nuts but I was calm on the outside it was the longest @NUM3 minutes ever!!!!"
