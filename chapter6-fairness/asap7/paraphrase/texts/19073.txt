"Last @CAPS3 my mom ordered @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was patient for an entire @CAPS3. One @CAPS3, few months and four months and five months to be exsact. Why? Well, the game came out this @CAPS3, on @DATE1 and I had to wait for. How did I pass the time? Simple, don∆t think about the game, try not to talk about the game and only write when it comes out on daily calenders. Even though I beat the game exactly thirty two times on every difficulty without any help. (heh,heh!) I still have to wait for another month or so for callop duty:@CAPS4. So this, ah, stinks because now I can∆t stop thinking about it."
