"ô@CAPS1 go!ö, I yelled while running to the entrance of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. ô@CAPS4 a minute, you got to @CAPS4 for your friendö, my mom said. As I stopped to @CAPS4 for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and @CAPS5 brother @PERSON2 I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park. ô@CAPS1 go to the top @CAPS7 @CAPS8ö, I said histaticly. ô@CAPS9, we can go on it, but me and @PERSON1 are staying in the backö, my mom said. ô@CAPS10 because me and @PERSON3 are going in the front row!ö, @PERSON2 yelled. As we started to walk to the line it said that it would be a @NUM1 minute @CAPS4 for us to go. After we got in line I thought to myself, wow this is a long line. It wasnÆt that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. ô@CAPS11!ö, the belt bucble sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. ô@CAPS12!ö, everybody said when we took off.  After that I told myself I can be patient."
