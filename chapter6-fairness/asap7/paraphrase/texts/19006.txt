"Patientce I was patient when I did not want to go wisconsic. Iwas patient on my way there (driving). I was possent when I was fishing, not complaining now boring it is. I wasnt about sleep on @CAPS1 ground. The whole camping trip I was patient. Story begins. @STATE1, took @NUM1 hours. In the car had a t.v. I wolened that for while and then I looked outside and say a moose! I screamed, ''moose!!'' my rooms boyfriend, mike stoped and backed up and that was my first time saw a moose. Then when we got there we set up our tent and then went fishing. I was patient for the fishing to bite my wom. I was so patient I got @NUM2 fish that day. Then when we came back i had to sleep on the groind. There was bumps and rocks under me, but didn't complain because thak how comping is. The next day we were on our way back and I couldn't fina the t.v. and didn't have a drink. I had to go to the bathroom. A sign said, a @CAPS2 station on exit @NUM3''.
