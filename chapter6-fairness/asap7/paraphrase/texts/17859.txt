"Im writing about the time I was patient at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the @LOCATION1 vs. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ? hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ?  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don∆t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again."
