A day of dreadful patience Ùcan we leave now @CAPS1. I∆m so bored I complained.ˆ I waited for an answer but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in @LOCATION1 waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. ÙThat∆s it I∆m gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don∆t touch anything.ˆ @CAPS1 said. So I sat here cold bored and hangry waiting for what seemed like hours. Finaly my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A fork lift driver not somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer. That∆s when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out and then all heard was holler∆s and screams. FINALY! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that some thing I definitely don∆t have is patience.
