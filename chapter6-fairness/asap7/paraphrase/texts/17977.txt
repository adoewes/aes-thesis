When I was in third grade I hoped one of my friends who had some disabilities but I had to learn to be patient with him. When it comes to dedating with someone like him patience plays a great part in friend ship with him. Ever though he had his days I would say to my self ''you have him and have patience '' and to this day him and I are still friends.
