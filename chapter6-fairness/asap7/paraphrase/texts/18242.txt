One day at the fair I was patient. I wanted to ride the bumper cars. So I got in line. There where about @NUM1 people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I waited in line until it was my turn. They let @NUM2 people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people got in front of us. Then after @NUM3 minutes it was our turn we picked our car and had some fun. That's a time when I was patient.
