"Patience is truly the hardest thing and body really ? that a ?.I hard to because im on punishment for not doing what I was suporse to do. So I have to be patient it and what it out until it was being patient it is what for a perfect of team to did. From my pop it of how. So while im on punishment I just waiting it out so my time will come because I can∆t speed up there and just make it ??? quicker but it  I could  I would but  for now I have to want. Im a permanent for quite a while so I can just be patient .I know before taking it hard but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to do it patience also helps the maker  and cam saved you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can want for certainly things like; money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, car (transportation, and things of the sudn because at you post rush every thing you want get it the way you were surpose to but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be!"
