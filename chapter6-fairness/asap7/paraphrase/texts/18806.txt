"A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 vaction. I was having a blast. My family didn∆t come because they don∆t like roller coasters. We dicided to ride the @CAPS1, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours @ORGANIZATION1 it and we even went on it twice."
