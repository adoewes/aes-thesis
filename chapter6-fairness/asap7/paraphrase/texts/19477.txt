"I∆m not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when I∆ve been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didn∆t complaine once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn∆t too bad. that was one of the few times I∆ve been  patient, and don∆t know if it counts since I was with somebody."
