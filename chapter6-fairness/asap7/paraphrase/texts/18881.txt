"A time when I was patient is when I play volleyball. I∆m patient when I play volleyball because when you don∆t score points, you don∆t get to serve. One game we weren∆t doing so well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand was doing great. Everybody got to serve except me on that maten. In the end our team ended up winning  I never complained one time about not being able to serve. Every body cheered and chanted because won by two points."
