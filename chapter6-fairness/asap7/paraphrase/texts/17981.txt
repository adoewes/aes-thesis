"Hi, im writing about the topic patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life it∆s not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren∆t patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2."
