"Patience is used when people are not in a hurry to gett were they are going. Like checking out at a store or at work, some people can be rood and not use their patience at school and work you should always use your patience, like for an example, use my patience at kinchat school because there are over one handred @NUM1, graders, and half of them are bushy when its lunch time and the other half gets hurt and they @CAPS1 don∆t know what to do."
