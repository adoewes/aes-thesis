Do you know someone who is patient? I do my mom is vary patient with us kids.  When I just blow my top my mom is still cool. All the time my littlel borther makes me so mad that I can∆t stand it. But she barly over is like that. Even when my grandma died she stayed cool. Two of my ants just brock. down that week. But thir good now. Every day thing don∆t make her vary uptite. When my sister makes her mad she always regrets it. I whant to punch her when she mackes mom mad because it wares off on me she crancke. So as you can see my mom ceps her patients so well.
