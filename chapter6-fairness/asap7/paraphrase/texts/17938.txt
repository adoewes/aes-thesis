"Patience is important in life. Something when you don∆t have patience things tend to go wrong and that∆s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don∆t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn∆t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn∆t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn∆t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn∆t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn∆t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn∆t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn∆t have patience. But if they did that wouldn∆t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not."
