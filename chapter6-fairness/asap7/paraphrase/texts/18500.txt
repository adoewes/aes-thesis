I was patient when it was my birthday and I didn∆t get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didn∆t do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing I didn∆t ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing. But that night while it was skating at skate port @NUM1 got nothing. Like at @TIME1 I saw my cousin and she gave me @MONEY1 for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and don∆t have to ask for something.
