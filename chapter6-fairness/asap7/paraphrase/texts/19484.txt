"When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom, and dad. @PERSON1 has downs syndromd. And he likes to wach game∆s. He like∆s to cheer them on whene their playing. He also like to give them hi fives after they are done playing. I did not laugh at him. I thought was a perty cool guy. He like to talk a lot about∆ suff like sport∆s are cartoon∆s. I dident make fon of him win he talk∆s. I dident win he walks and or win he make nosies that are funny. He think of every one as his filend wich they are. When he standing in line he dosent move vary much. He yell∆s wen @DATE1 port has the ball and is heading for a tuch down. When he gets mad when spirg port, don∆t have the ball and they score. I @CAPS1 him That we will get it @CAPS2. He say yeha I now that. So he like∆s to go on to the feeld to wach. But they won∆t let on the feeld yet so I @CAPS1 him to be patience so he will calm down. When the game∆s over his mom take∆s us to @LOCATION1 house. We sat in the @CAPS2 being roud and taking. But she did not get mad.even now we had to set in a hour traffic jame. So after all that what I think patience is."
