"One day I had to wait about @NUM1 hours which seemed like a year, but I didn∆t complain. I sat in the doctors office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom terted her freind. About three people got called in fourty- five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine. They called a kid who∆s name was @PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my names @PERSON2. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but its just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finnally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finnally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with there machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I don∆t know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finnally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, ÙI have not a clueˆ."
