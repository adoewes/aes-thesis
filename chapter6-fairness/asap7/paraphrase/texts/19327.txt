"Patience, can you be patient? Some people are and some are and some  are not. Some time  I can not. Well hear is a story about patience. One time at school in the lunch line, it was long. It would bearl  move. I wanted lunch so bad I was not being patient. But for some resson my friend was being patient. I said to her why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to  get something to eat. I said yeah that is true. So I tryed to be patient and before I know it I was siting by my friends  talking and eating my food."
