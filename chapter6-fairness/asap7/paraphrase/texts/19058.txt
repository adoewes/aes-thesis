"I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was becoming impatience just waiting their. But sudden ly I saw the line move. So then I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just reilized it was a hour we been waiting. Under standing in patience means you know why you have to stand their waiting. Because you can∆t push or shuvie your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can∆t do or get what ever you wan∆t unless you truble. You can∆t hit, cut, push, or shuve to the front of the line, you just have to wait."
