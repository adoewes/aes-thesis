"One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!"
