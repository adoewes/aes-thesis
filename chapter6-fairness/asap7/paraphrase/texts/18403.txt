I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to fuzzys and it took a long time. It took @NUM1 minutes. It seemed like took forever. It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I did∆t eat nothing. There was me my mom and dad. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry. I had tries to. Some people have patient and other don∆t. I kind of have patients. But this time I had no patients. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patients.
