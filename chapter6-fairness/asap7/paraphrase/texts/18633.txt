"I have been patient many time here are a few of them. First, I was patient for my friend. I patient with him because we were going to walk to school. He told me one minute, but it was more like twenty. We barely made it to first hour. Another way I was patient was when my mom and I went to go get my new shoes from @ORGANIZATION1. When my mom and I were waiting the man in the store went to go get the shoes. The man walked back there and took like a half an hour. But it was worth it for my new shoes. These are only a few ways I was patient."
