"Aplause  filled the building after the first dance ended. I was back stage with my dance team going over routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crouded and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long. ô@CAPS1 many more dances?ö and ôwhat dance are we on?ö @CAPS2 what everyone had on there mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on excited bored and nervous. Then finally it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting  that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience!"
