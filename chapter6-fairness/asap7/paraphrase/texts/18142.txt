"ô@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!ö my poms coach @PERSON1 says as we practice the dance over and over again. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring. We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didnÆt even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didnÆt get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldnÆt believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced ô@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon teamö then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field. We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasnÆt so bad anymore.  It was all worth the wait."
