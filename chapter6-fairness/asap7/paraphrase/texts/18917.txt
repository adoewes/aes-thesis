"Have you ever waited for something that seemed so @CAPS1 away, that seemed to take so @CAPS2 to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just @DATE1 I took the @CAPS3.A.T to get into the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also know as @CAPS8, (@NUM1-@CAPS9) I had to wake up at @NUM2 am, on a @DATE2, to get ready. I had to beat @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM3. When I got there, I had to wait in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took @CAPS10 @CAPS11 to take the test! With three breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about @NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the, we all got solo way afterwards and roamed the campus. It turned out to be a great day!"
