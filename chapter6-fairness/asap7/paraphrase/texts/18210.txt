"On my last trip at @CAPS1 point I made a horrible mistake. I waited in line for @NUM1 hours on the mantis. I had to be patient, but it was hard to becauseà the mister fans were having tecinal diffucatties . And how can I be patient when it is @NUM2 degrees outside?! The only good part of the line was the shade. That was @NUM3 way I kept my patience."" I told my self, ""and in no time you will be there."" @CAPS2 I spoke too soon. Half an hour seemed like @NUM4 hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally, after @NUM5 hours in line the mist fans @DATE1 to lift. Patience can bring luck. I wait for what seems like only ten minutes but accaully was an hour. After I got off the ride, I was releaved. I guess patience in some ways, is the key to success."
