"Hunting when you are turkey hunting you need to be extremly still and quiets did you have to have a lot of patience. If you move even a musle all the turkeys will run away. Some times you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. I remember when I was  hunting with my dad @CAPS1 sitting under a tree fro probablee three hours and finally a turkey came, unfortunutly just about when I had a shot my dad scared them all away but I still had the patience to stay out there for another @NUM1 hours. That is my example of patience."
