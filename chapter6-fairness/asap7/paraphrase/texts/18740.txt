"The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. @CAPS5 were loading up for a three-hour drive to the @CAPS1 water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if @CAPS3 was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother @CAPS2 was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until @CAPS3 finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" @CAPS3 exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" @CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than @CAPS3 had. Which tells you a lot?Tyler comes out @NUM1 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another @NUM2 minutes which my brother mad. ""@CAPS4 took you so long?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""@CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered. As soon as @CAPS5 got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least @CAPS5 were all patient, except for my brother @CAPS3's still like that now."
