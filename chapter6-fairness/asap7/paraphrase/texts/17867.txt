"I am not a patient person at all. But sometimes I have to be like my birthday for instance, I would love it if my birthday came at least every month. But of course, I only have @NUM1 birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. It∆s just not in the cards for me. My father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car @DATE1 I told him I didn∆t do it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldn∆t be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldn∆t force them to or anything but I∆m not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. Although if I∆m Ùpatient,ˆ I∆m sure I will be able to do it!"
