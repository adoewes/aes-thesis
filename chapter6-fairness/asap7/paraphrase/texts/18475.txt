"One time when I was patient was when we flew in the @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the I asked school. We flew to @LOCATION4 well and the to @ORGANIZATION1 but after that it was down hill. When we got to @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! after an hour I got bored with my little brother with us didn∆t help at all. Then over the intereem we hear that we have to go through security now and sit in a room with a gift shop ??? all for @NUM1 hurs. When there was an hour left there was another announcement and it was that we will be delayed three more hours, after that I was listening to my ipod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally get to leave we walk up to six seater phase for us to fly to a small island near by. When we got to @LOCATION1 we hurry to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours."
