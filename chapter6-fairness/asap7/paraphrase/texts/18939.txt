"Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient, I understanding but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the @NUM1 grade my math teacher∆s assistant had to be so patient with our because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and than have to reteach it before to living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask questions. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people."
