"IÆve been to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 before, my family and I went about a year ago. Their were so many rides! we were astounded of how many people were  their. My family and I decided to go on the little rides first. We went on things like the ô @CAPS2 trapö, ô@CAPS3 starö,. Also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and  I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the ô@CAPS4 timbers.ö The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to. Their was line of prolly @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didnÆt want to wait long. She said ôyou need patienceö  I said ok fine ! It was the ride, it was pretty fun .After we got off I said ômom that patience really paid offö."
