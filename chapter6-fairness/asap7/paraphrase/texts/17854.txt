"One day, a few years ago, I woke up and my mom said we were going  to my grandma∆s house. So started to get ready. After I was done getting dressed I looked on.  My dresser and grabbed my @MONEY2 @MONEY3 that I was saving up to buy something just incase we went to the store When we got there I saw my cousin∆s dad @CAPS1 walking a puppy. I walked up to him and asked about the dog, he said it was his brothers dog and he was selling it. My mom said I could get a dog so I asked him how much did he coast. @CAPS1 said @MONEY1. I got really excited because I had @MONEY2 and could get @MONEY3 from my granding. So I called my mom but she was busy somewhere else but she told me that she wanted to see the dog before I buy him. So @CAPS1 waited their for hours but my mom took forever. Then finally I got impatience and bought him. But my wow wasn∆t mad because she ended up liking him"
