"One of my storys of being patient is this one time was at my uncles nonse and I wanted to play the tboy @NUM1. Well the was like five other kids to and I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited like for a hour or two atleast it felt like it and I didn∆t say a word about it the whole time, then I finally got to play. That∆s my story about being patient."
