"A time when I was pacient is when I∆m at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill pacients is the key. For example when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to hand stand it was difficult. Day after, day I never could do it. I put my personl best ever day but I had to be pacient my coach said. He said when the day comes you∆ll do it but until then you need to keep trying and do the best you can do. It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill he said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me ÙI told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it. This is a time I had to use patcience to get my new skill. I learned being pacient is hard and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you."
