"One day I went to the hospitle the nurses gave me a ivy, akatt scan and pulled tare of my arm. It hurt so bad but I was patient through all of it. First when I was getting a cat scan I did not want to do it but we had to so I did it and was very patient. Also when they gave me my ivy they missed my vain so the riped it out put it in my other arm so I was very patient for the pain to go down. Lastly when I was done at @NUM1 oclock pm and started at @NUM1 oclock am there was a big pice of tape on my arc for @NUM3 hours the nurse came and said ""we can go home now"" and said ""you can take the tape off now swettie."" I said ""ok"" I pulled it pice by pice then the nurse said 'herer lett me do it!' she said ""@NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6"" and pulled it off it hurt so bad but I was patient and didn't cry or??? Now you know that I was patient and was hurt all day."
