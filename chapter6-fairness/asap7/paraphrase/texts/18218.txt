"One time when I was patient was when the shot flew was going around. I had to go to this one place to get the flew shots. When we got there we got in line, I had to be patient because the line was really long is??? the line to get through. We brought chairs, hot coce and staff to do to keep us any feet. I had to be patient in tell I got on to the front of the line. The worse part was that most of the tide was outside and it was @CAPS1 eve, so I had to be patient in the cold, when we finally got inside the building I was so happy. Then about @DATE1 we got to the front of the line. IÆm glad that I never have to wait in line for three hours to get a flew shot again."
