He chated with his friends all star and then class was over. Then he goes to @NUM2 hour science and there is a lab with partners. @CAPS3 him and @PERSON2 decide to be partners. Half way through the lab they dont know what to do. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 goes up to the teacher and interupts her and another student. @CAPS3 the teacher says ill be with you in a moment, but he continues to bug her. @CAPS3 he got a step. Then later that day he was in @CAPS2 and was working on a work sheet but the teacher was writing with the principal. @CAPS3 he decided to wait for her to be done @CAPS3 he wouldn∆t get in trouble, but it was taking much longer than expected @CAPS3 he noved th next problem∆s. then the teach comes back and he got her help. @CAPS3 in conclusion @PERSON1 learned two lesson that day.
