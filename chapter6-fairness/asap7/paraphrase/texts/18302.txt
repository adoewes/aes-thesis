"One day when the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out I wanted it so bad so I asked my mom and she said maby for @CAPS2 and guess what @CAPS2 was coming up. It was @DATE1 and I couldn∆t wait so I went to school and I got it over with every day and I kept coming there and sayingˆ I∆m for sure that I will get a @ORGANIZATION1 just like momˆ and that∆s about the handreth time I said that to her and she said Ù you have to be patient or I will probley never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you say saying I want this and that he∆s going to think @LOCATION1 is not real so be patient. Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didn∆t care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days I∆m being patient I really can∆t believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when I∆m getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so I∆m really exited. So I was on a @CAPS5 break on the last @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I played video games to save up my time of being patient then the last @NUM3 days I∆ve been  playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there whose only @NUM3 more days antil @CAPS5 and I just played outside intel the day was over on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on @CAPS5 eve. Then the day came @CAPS5 finaly I saw  my presents and my mom said ya open them sort starred to seen them and once I opened all my present I did not see the @CAPS3, antil my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the @CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I don∆t have to be patient no more, the end"
