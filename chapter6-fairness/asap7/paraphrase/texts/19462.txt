"I was patient at the dentist office. When I went to the dentist office, I was getting my bracts put on. When I was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and wire. While they were getting the brackets and wire I got to pick out colors. I waited about @NUM1 mins. Without complaining. Next, they started putting the brackets on the glue. When they put one bracket on I felt so weird and kido tasted like heated metal ô@CAPS1ö I said. After they had put on the brockets and then they put colors. My mouth hurt like crazy! When it was all over I noticed  it had been @NUM2 hours! I was surprised because I didnÆt know I sat there for @NUM2 hours, but I was very patient and waited that whole time! ThatÆs the time I was patient at the dentist office."
