"I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn∆t even know that means, but if I∆m patient I∆ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it."
