"I was very patient last time I went to the doctors, @CAPS1 and my brother @CAPS2 had to wait outside in the waiting room until they called us in for our shots. Everybody else was getting to go a head of as and we stayed patient. It got really boring sitting in there but we stayed patient. After about two or three hours we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago. So we decide to go up and ask what was going on .We found out that we forgot to sign in and so once we did we got in."
