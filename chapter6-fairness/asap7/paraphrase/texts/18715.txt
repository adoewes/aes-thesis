"The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said ô@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1ö and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up aheadö and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said ô@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1ö! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong"
