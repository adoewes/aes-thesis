One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you∆ll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters.
