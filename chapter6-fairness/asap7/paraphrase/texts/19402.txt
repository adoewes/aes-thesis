Over @DATE1 break a few years ago me and my family whent to @LOCATION1. We did lots of thinks while we were there. When we had to go home we had to whate for a plain. We got up an our ealy so we could pack up and get to the airport. When we got there we had to be patient wile we reterned the rental car and go through sicuritey. When we got throw security we had to whate for the plain to arive. We sat for over an hour befor the plain came in. when the plain arived we had to whate for the plain to be cleaned, passes checked, and everyone was on bored. That was the time I had to be patient.
