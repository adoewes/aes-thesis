"A time when i was patient was at the @NUM1 birthday bash where i used to live i was waiting  in line and the line was like a mile long so i waited and waited and then finally i go to look for my ticket and forget i left it in the car so I had to go all the way back. So then i get back which got twice as big as before then I wait some more it sucked then outta nowhere it starts raining, I dn∆t got an umbrellla, I∆m still waiiting. How could it get any worse? Well over it did  they shut down the concert. So i went home soaking wet, my feet and hands. So i jus lay go to sleep and relax. P.S worse day of my life."
