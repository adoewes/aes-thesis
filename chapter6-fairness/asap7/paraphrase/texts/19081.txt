"Patience. Wow, you want critism; are you sure? We∆ll since you asked for it,  it looks like I∆m have to give it to you. Patience is @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We about need it every day.) @CAPS2 does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant.  Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until @CAPS2 you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so you∆ll have to learn patience. That is one word I do not like @CAPS1 when its something I really want.so that is my story about patience explained my way."
