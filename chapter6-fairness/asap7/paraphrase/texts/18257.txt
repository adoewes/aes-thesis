"Patients for me is hard but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didn∆t have my physical. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and @NUM1 other people were sitting and watching for @NUM2 @DATE1!!!. I wasn∆t vary patient then but @DATE1 on at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctors office thingy, so I could get my physical done. So me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paper work because she didn∆t make me all appointment. So that took about @NUM3 min. then we waited, and waited, and waited until @NUM4 and @DATE1 if you add that up this @NUM2 @DATE1 waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient but my mom definitely wasn∆t. So finally they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for @NUM3 min. then finally they gave us the paper/ physical, and then we left. Practice ended at @NUM7 and we didn∆t get home until @NUM8!!!. That is a time I was patient."
