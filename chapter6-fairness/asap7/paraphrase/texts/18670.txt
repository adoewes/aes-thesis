"My mom is very patient woman. She shows it by helping my brother @PERSON1, with his homework. @PERSON1 hates every thing about doing his homework. He hates, doing his math, reading, but most of all he hates, spelling. When my mom is helping him with all three of thoose things she shows patience because since he hates all of thoos homework assignments he doesn∆t always do them without a sit. When he does throw a fit she is very patient with him and works on it with him until he is done that is how my mom shows patience."
