"My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to chang the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and I∆m not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very invoked because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted on that didn∆t break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a @CAPS1 amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it, I also never wanted to stay clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do."
