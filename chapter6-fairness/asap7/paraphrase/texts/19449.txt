"My friend and others showed loyalty in a play called @CAPS1 children∆s @CAPS2 . They come once every year. Everyone gets ready, learns their parts and we put on a show in a week. We showed loyalty by believing in each other. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by reminding them the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by saying it for them. We showed each other loyalty throughout @NUM1 days. The play turns out great each and every year from supporting each other."
