"There was a time I had to go to my doctor for a monthly for a monthly chek up. When we got to the building my aunt and I relized that there were more cars there than usuall. When we stepped inside we noticed that a flier said ô@NUM1 shots @DATE1 threw @DATE2.ö @CAPS1 when we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room we seen @NUM2 people. Luckly not all the people were waiting for @PERSON1, but I did have to wait for an hour and fortyfive minituts. @CAPS1 when I finally got to see my doctor she gave me my shot and made shure I was ok. After a long day I went home took a big nap."
