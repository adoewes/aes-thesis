"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a few days after @CAPS18 began to run, @CAPS3, a small, anxious, chestnut room @CAPS1 saw her @CAPS5 plowing a large oval and covering it with @CAPS4 looked like dust. ""@CAPS4's @CAPS5 doing, @CAPS6? "" @CAPS7 a very curious @CAPS3. ""@CAPS9's plowing."" @CAPS10 @CAPS11, the young horses' @CAPS17. ""@CAPS12's going to be in a race called the @ORGANIZATION1  next year and that's how @CAPS18 will practice."" I want to race! ""hollered @CAPS3 excitedly ""Patience my darling, you're not even a filly! ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11, conclusively. And so @CAPS3 waited patiently for weeks.
