"A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush because I was running late. It was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 appointment was at @TIME1. I was at least @NUM2 minutes away from the place. When we got there it was basically @NUM3, so I missed @CAPS1 appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time @CAPS1 mother and I had to wait until all the people who made their appointment wer finished. We waited at least an hour an a half. As I was being patient I talked on the phone and went on the internet. Lastly I listened to music the rest of the time until they called @CAPS1 name. In conclusion this is a time when I was patient."
