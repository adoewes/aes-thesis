"Do you have a mother who is bisy all the time. If not i do. For some reason I like travel every where with her. One day we went to a place that I forgot the name of. I was so patient. Being patient is kind of hard because, you really dont have nothing to do. @CAPS1 took her like @NUM1. I was happy when we left but I wasnt say things like, come on, hurry up, @CAPS1Æs taking to long, @CAPS2 hungry, @CAPS2 ready to leave and things like that."
