"A time that I showed patience is when my sister broke my futon. It was the day that I had gotten it and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a suddent I heard ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!"" I ran upstairs to find out what happend and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost.  I showed patience by not yelling at them. I soon got another futon that isn't broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And that is my story on how I showed patience once!"
