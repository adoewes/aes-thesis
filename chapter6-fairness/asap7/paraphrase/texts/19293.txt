"I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasn∆t even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited until the school year started but my mom told I would have to wait another week because she didn∆t have the money from all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents plan a trip to @LOCATION1 that weeket, so I had to wait another week. It was on the following @DATE1 when I was at my cousin∆s house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy that I finally got it. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient."
