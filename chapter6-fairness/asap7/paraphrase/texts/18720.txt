Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don∆t have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don∆t have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don∆t think if I didn∆t have any patients I wouldn∆t be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don∆t have and they get bad grades and everything.
