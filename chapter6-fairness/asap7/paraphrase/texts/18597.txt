"Have you ever been a patient? Like at the @CAPS1∆s office?  Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me that I had to go see the @CAPS1.  When we went in we seen this man rushed to the @LOCATION1.  We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seat to sit in.  After about @CAPS2 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have nomonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was holding my mom∆s hand. She came unto us holding piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection.  When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake.  When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient."
