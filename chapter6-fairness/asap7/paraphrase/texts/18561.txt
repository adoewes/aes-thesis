In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world.
