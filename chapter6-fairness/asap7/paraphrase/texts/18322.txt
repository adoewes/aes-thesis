"At time when I was patient when I really wanted to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 I woke up and I told my dad that I wanted to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 my dad said ôlets go.ö @CAPS1 we went to the store and it said that it was closed. @CAPS1 I check the hours and they were going to open in @NUM1 minutes. @CAPS1 my dad and me being patients. Well mostly my dad because he did not say ôletÆs goö or anything. @CAPS1 @NUM2 mntues past and we had @NUM3 more minutes to wait. Finally @NUM3 minutes past and it was time, but the people that worked there said to wait about @NUM3 minutes cause they had to set up things. @CAPS1 my dad like always nice. He waited @NUM3 more minutes, @CAPS1 we could go in. Now finally @NUM3 minutes past and we got to go inside and I was @CAPS1 happy. Being patient is the best thing ever. No complaining or nothing."
