"One time I was patient. It was dec @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 eve. I was so excited that @CAPS1. On @CAPS1 eve morning I slept till @NUM2 I wanted to?? To come. I was patient so I played video games not thinking about @CAPS1. When I went to the store I seen all the @CAPS1 things. I felt like I could∆t wait no longer. That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up. I made some more food and went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there was the presents. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some to @NUM3 came and I wanted to open them so??? I knew it would∆t be right so I went to sleep??? At noon I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy I waited."
