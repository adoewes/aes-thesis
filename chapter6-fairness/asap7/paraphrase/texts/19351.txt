"I didn∆t know where we were at. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called buddies. I∆ve never been there until that day. Then the waitress put us at a circular table. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a diet pepsie. My sister got a fruit punch. As always. My mom and dad got a mountain dew. My brother got cherry pepsie. I don∆t know why we all got different drinks. It took @NUM1 minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasn∆t so patient. He knew that the food will take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for that was @NUM2 minutes. My dad was very impatient. I was the only patient one at our table. The resturaunt wasn∆t even that busy. I told my dad to just be patient the food will be right out any minutes. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient."
