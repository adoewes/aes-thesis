I have to be patient all the time when IÆm teaching my puppy (@PERSON1) right from wrong when are you patient? @PERSON1 is a new part of my family and he is still learning right from wrong. I try to teach him things every day and when I go over it like @NUM1 times I get kind a mad. Mom tells me that @PERSON1 is just learning and to be patient with him it helps train him faster! I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things and if IÆm patient he will learn faster
