"I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and did not get one. Some other guys shot one they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time."
