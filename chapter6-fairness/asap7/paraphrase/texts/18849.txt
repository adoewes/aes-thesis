"A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part @NUM1 of the rest and I was very anxious and I wanted to get up and more around, but were taking the @CAPS1 so I could not. Instead I entertaind myself in any way I could such as pretend singer writing running songs through my head repeatedly, even twiddling my thumbs! So finally she let us get and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends so I just talked to them. Somehow we got into talking about dangeons and dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. anyway I kept trying too talk but I keep geting interupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. Finnaly it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch so I never did get to say what mine was.This is a time when I was patient."
