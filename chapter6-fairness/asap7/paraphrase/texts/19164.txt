One day my dad and I had a doctor∆s appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there on time. Then my dad and I sat there for a while. We thought it would take a few more minutes. So we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went and asked other doctors how long is it going to take. The doctors said abott @NUM2 more minutes so we waited for @NUM2 more minutes. The doctor  still didn∆t come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes. My dad went to the doctor again. They said few more minutes we waited for @NUM2 more minutes there the doctor called us. So the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went in the room the doctor said sorry! because he was late. That∆s how me and my dad were patient.
