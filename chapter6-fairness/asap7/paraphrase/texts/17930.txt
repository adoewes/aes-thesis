I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didn∆t keep my mouth shut so my mom didn∆t want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That∆s exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.
