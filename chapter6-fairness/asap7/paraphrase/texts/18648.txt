"In @DATE1 my dad had a business trip in @CAPS1 dinsney land. We got to the park and rode some rides .My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did. After a while I saw something cool, space @CAPS2. I got in line and I saw a sign, @NUM1 hours until lift off! My mom was shocked so we left. I was so disapointed. We came back the next day and the wait was @NUM2 hours. We got in line and waited and waited and waited. After @NUM3 minutes I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave but the line was to big to get out. After hours that seemed like years we got to the front, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom got out of line and so did my sister, but I stay. I waited all by myself for @NUM4 minutes when I got on the coaster! It was fun, and I got a fastoas for @NUM5 other rides! In the end my patience paid off."
