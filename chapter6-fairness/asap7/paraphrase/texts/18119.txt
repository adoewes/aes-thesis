"The time that I was patient was today when everyone was takeing the @CAPS1.E.A.P. when we all get into the classroom nobody what so ever did not want to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P, when our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, nobody wanted to. So when we got the  paket that we had to bubble in our answers we had to fill something out on the front of the paket. Then we had to put our first and last name on it befour we could take a break. When the break was over we needed to get a n free reading book and our teacher had to read all of us the directions to us we ,got started and when everyone was finished she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break, when everyone went she read the directions to the other part and when everyone was doing that same people got done really early and they got really board and they didn∆t want to read so then they all started to talk she would be right back that she had to go to the bathroom so once someone to came in and would wach us then all of the guys would make paper basket balls and started to shot them into into the tiny basket ball hoope and then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we  would be starting the last writing sesson and that after this it would be lunch and it might even go though or lunch and then everyone was  freaking out. So that was the time that I was just patient."
