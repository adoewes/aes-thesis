"If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1∆s @CAPS1, that∆s a different story. I∆ll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1∆s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldn∆t be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldn∆t get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn∆t help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1∆s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if I∆m very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait."
