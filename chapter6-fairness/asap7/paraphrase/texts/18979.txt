"A day that I was patient was, one day I was really happy about my birthday coming up. I couldnÆt wait to see @CAPS1 I was getting. I though about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me @CAPS1 I was getting. The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at @CAPS1 I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would name faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was takeing forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said ôah-ah I know @CAPS1 your getting and you donÆt. ôAnd I jumped up and said @CAPS1! How come you know and I donÆt? ôThatÆs bad tell me pleaseö And he said no ôthen I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said ôI give upö she looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. ôthen I walked away. Then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up I was so happy to finally see @CAPS1 I was getting. And that was the day I was patient."
