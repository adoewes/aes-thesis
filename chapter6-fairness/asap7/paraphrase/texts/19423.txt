"My dad is in the @ORGANIZATION1. He goes away for long periods of time. The only time he comes to ritit us is in @DATE1, near my birthday. But one year my dad wasn't able to come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the trooper for an extra six months. I felt depressed for the longest time. But then I thought about it. Even it was delayed, he was still coming back hopefully. So I decided to be patient rather than disappointed. Our family sent him care packager over. Eventually he did came back. That was a hard time, but it was patient and got thought it."
