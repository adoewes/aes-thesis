"Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when itÆs the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. ô@CAPS1 @CAPS2ö the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasnÆt back yet I didnÆt know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4Æd only been gone for five fast muinets. I didnÆt belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. ô@CAPS3!ö I shouted, ôI donÆt have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flopö I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  ô@NUM1 minets till midnightö @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me ôThatÆs impossibleö I told her. ôYou can make it.ö @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasnÆt that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. ô@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happenö how is it going to endö @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. ô@CAPS9 was that wait really that badö @CAPS10 asked. ôI guess notö I answerd sheepishly. ôBeing patient payed offÆ @CAPS10 lectured. I didnÆt reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that IÆm a little better at being patient things will be a lot better."
