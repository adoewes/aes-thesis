The time I was patient was when I went @CAPS1 fishin with my step dad. I could not wait for long so I decided to talk to myself or sing songs. My step dad said you set ur pole down on a sling shot holder and do whatever. So I went walk around explore the world and I was think about how I can do patience. I was to go check on my pole and I got nothing so I feel in the coast out for way so I sat wait and wait but until that moment my pole start to jak around so I reel in caught a large @CAPS1 I was so happy. My step dad said see you do got patience.
