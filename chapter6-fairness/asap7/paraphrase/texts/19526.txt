Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital. What I do to pass time when IÆm at the doctors is play I spy. I play it with my mom every time. There is usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go. There is magazines but I think they are boring. Therefore I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise I would be very very bored.
