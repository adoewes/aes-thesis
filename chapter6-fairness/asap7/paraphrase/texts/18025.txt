"When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here! I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family and my cousins were gooing  to be coming in from @LOCATION1. I was so exited and very impatient I couldn∆t wait until they pulled up in their black car and I could give them a hug that would knock the daylights out of them. It was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten say they are gonning to be here in @NUM1 but they were never their. Soon i realized it was about @NUM2 p.m and knew i wouldn∆t see them untill tomorrow and i will be patient so i don∆t waste the whole entire day thinking about it. After a good nights rest i got up are breakfast, and then watched some @CAPS2. @PERSON1! @PERSON1! Honk!Honk! could it really be no it couldn∆t it was uncle @CAPS3 and his big motorcycle. A few hours later i heard @PERSON1 again and said uncle @CAPS3 is probably leaving but then i herd my cousins @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5 flew up out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked  the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key."
