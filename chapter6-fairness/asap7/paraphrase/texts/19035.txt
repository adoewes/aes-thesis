One time when I was patient was my birthday I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone and that∆s all I wanted. All of my friends had them I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn∆t know where I was. It is just a need right now because they are very helpful. My birthday was  on a @DATE1 so the night before I was at the football game everybody was asking if I was going to get me and I kept on telling  them yes I∆m getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift that I got was the cell phone and I was really happy and I started to get all of my friends numbers. I learned when your patient and not asking you will get what you want.
