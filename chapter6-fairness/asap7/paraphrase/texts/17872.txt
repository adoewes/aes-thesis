"One time when I was patient was when me and my family, went on a fishing trip to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1.  Once we got on the boat it took @NUM1 minutes to go through the river. Then at @NUM2 we just waited, trolling through the water. Rocking side to side like a baby in its crib. Setting up all the poles and tures. Then around @NUM3 we got our first hit. My dad rushed over to get the pole and started reaching as fast as he could. Eventually he got it in it was a, @ORGANIZATION1 at @MONEY1. Then around @NUM4, another pole got a hit I rushed over grabbed the pole and started realing it in. With some help my fish turned out to be a king @ORGANIZATION1 that came in at @NUM5. and @NUM6 inches tall. That is why it always helps to be patient. You never know  what∆s  going to happen if you are patient."
