When I was going to the doctor I had to be patient I went there because my auntie driveway had a crack. And I was riding my scooter. I must wasn∆t paying no attention because my scooter. Had hit the crack so I sprang my knee. So my dad camed out the house to pick me up. I had to get in a wheel chair. And wait because there wasn∆t no more curtains left. I waited for a hour then I got my turn. And they checked my knee. Then they gave me chounces to walk with. It was pretty hard to go up my house stairs.
