One time at the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I was getting some arrows but no one was there to ring up my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times I just waited there quitley and patiently. I was waiting for about @NUM1 min for some to come and when some one did come they said thank you for being so patienet and ringed me up so I could leave. That was a time I was patient.
