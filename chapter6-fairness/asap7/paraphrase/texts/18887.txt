One beautiful morning @CAPS1 went to renew his lisence. But me though if he wake up really early he would be the only one there. But of course he wouldn't be the only one there. Unfortunitly everyone thought the same thing. But @CAPS1 was really tired he woke up at @NUM1 am o'clock but they open at @NUM2 am but @CAPS1 didn't know that. So @CAPS1 went to the panacake house and got him a nice hot coffee but when he came back there was a line around the coner. But @CAPS1 waited and waited and @CAPS1 got his lisence.
