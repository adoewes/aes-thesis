"One time I was patient was when my brother broke his arm. I was a fine day and was playing outside on the play ground, during lunch resses. He said that he was on the monkey bars. His hands got all sweaty and he slipped. Eric fell on his arm. He screamed. The resses ladies brought him to the office and called my parents. Then my parents called my school to tell them they were picking me up. They picked me up and then got my bother. We drove to the hospital and they did x-rays. It took forever. I sat there quietly for @NUM1 hours! My parents told me that they appretiated now I was very patient. That the time I was patient."
