"Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you ôdonÆt have the timeö to do something then you donÆt have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldnÆt be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldnÆt be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as ô@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.ö @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now"
