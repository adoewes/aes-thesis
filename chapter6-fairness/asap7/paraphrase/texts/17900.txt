"There was one time I was patient when my little brothers play station wasnÆt working so it took a while to get use to it. It was an @TIME1 and my little brother had jus finished eating and he wanted to play his @CAPS1 but he was having a hard time turning it on but the problem was that some of his games were scratched up. But the next day we bought him a lot of other games that were brand new. So as he tried the games he still couldn`t do it. So than he asked me if I can help him so I helped him but it still didn`t work until I cleared up the play station than we had to wait patiently and than finaly at??? but  my little brother and I say ô work, work, work, workö until it went on. Then this day we still say that for the @CAPS1 can work."
