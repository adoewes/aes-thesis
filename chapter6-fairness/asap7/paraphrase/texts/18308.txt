"Some people a completely patient. Some people aren∆t patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patientce, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it∆s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When we∆re going somewhere special, or I∆m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It∆s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can∆t always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when I∆m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I∆m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn∆t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don∆t have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don∆t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers aren∆t always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time!"
