I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for @NUM2 or @NUM3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for @NUM4 min then we sit back down and start the part @NUM5 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.
