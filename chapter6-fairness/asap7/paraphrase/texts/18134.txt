Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don∆t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don∆t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should∆nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don∆t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.
