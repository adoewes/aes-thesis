"Once on @DATE1 break my family and I went to @LOCATION1. While we were at @LOCATION1 we went to a huge water park. My two sisters and I convinced my parents to go there. A few days later we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothing, and started looking for waterslides. Right as we walked in there was a huge (take) sunken ship. On the very to where zip- lines! We all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line. Not a short line. A giant line. We must have been there @NUM1 minutes waiting. Eventually it came my turn. I grabbed the handle and kicked off the ground. I had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. I let go falling into a pool. The wait was totally worth it!"
