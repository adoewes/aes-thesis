"One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside this talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said Ùyesˆ. So I went and packed some things to take because they don∆t have anything. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and was all fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a test saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she this ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said ÙI don∆t knowˆ of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didn∆t listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didn∆t work because she didn∆t talk. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said Ùwhyˆ. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didn∆t reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back Ùhereˆ. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I don∆t know why she didn∆t talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient."
