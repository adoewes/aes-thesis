I was patient when I was at my friend∆s house in the winter shoveling a sleding slot so we can but water on it to make ice. When we where shoveling it was hard become we had to got through lots of snow just  to got to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient gye when. We do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was because it was getting dark and I has to go soon. But before I became unpatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice but that didn∆t bother me at all. That∆s how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But‡ I couldn∆t  or we couldn∆t go on it that night because it was to late. I that∆s my story about  patientce  The @CAPS1
