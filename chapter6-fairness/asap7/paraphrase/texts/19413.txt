"I am in the @LOCATION3 @CAPS1 sea cadet corps .When I packed my things in the truck I had wait in a @NUM1 hour car ride till I get to my training in port @LOCATION2. We were driving in a truck that fit five people we were fitting @NUM2 people in it, I was the one stuck in the back with all the gour. Some ones sea bag had a boat in it that was stabling in my back I tried so hard not to complain about it, it took all my patience to last half the way there till I had to move the boot in my bay I grabbed the bag that had the boot in it and there wit to the other side. When  I thought all was well @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started sighing at very annoying song I didnÆt  think my patient could handle staying in that torch with their sighing .Finally we were at port @LOCATION2. @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 stop sighing and my patience had held through. But then there was the cheat in line their were @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 at me waiting to check IÆd had a feeling my patience was gonna blow up and IÆd go crazy. But it didnÆt I stayed there patiently until it was any turn to check in, sadly the officer at the check in desk was old and talked very slown it was so hard understanding what he was saying. I finally was checked in my patience had survived!!Then I found out my friend logon was banked up gave me. Which he can be very annoying.ö @CAPS4 boy I thought,ö here comes another test ror my patiences. My patience was tested through the as ride, the clean in line, and also through that whole training. But my patience was very strong and survived!!!"
