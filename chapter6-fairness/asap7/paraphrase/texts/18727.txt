"Patience @CAPS1 is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient, if your not patient that means you are just about practicly mean because you are judging someone or makeing them do something really fast. For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying ôhurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody."
