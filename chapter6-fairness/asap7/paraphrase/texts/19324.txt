One time I was going hunting. We got to the woods @NUM1 or earlier. When we got there we found a spot to sit on the ground. We were goin  to stay in the woods till dark or we kill our limit of deer. When it was or @NUM2 ?  hour till dark we seen a dow but when we moved the gun to shoot it it ran. We stade not moving or talkin  waitin. Then more deer came. But they were really small so we let them go. When their was like @NUM3 minutes left till dark a good size dow came. It was to far away tho  so we waited for it to get closer  the boom the rifle goes off. It dropped but it was still alive laying down. We waited like @NUM4 or  more minutes then it died. That was one of the times  I was patient.
