I was patient when I was waiting for a guy to ask me out::) and I∆m still dating him this day. His name is @PERSON1 and yes he goes in my school when he asked me out I didn∆t now what to say cause he took to long and I still did not like another guy but him. When someone patient that don∆t rush threw they wait for something or someone like I did. When I was patient I didn∆t ask him @NUM1 times I waited until he asked me out cause if someone doesn∆t like they might turn you down and hurt you. Okay well if you don∆t want to take my advice get hurt.
