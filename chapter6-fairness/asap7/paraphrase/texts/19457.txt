"Someone was in line for hot & ready pizza since they are hot and ready, a lot of people were in line and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza is supposed to hot and ready. Everybody was throwing tanruns. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching them doing tanrums. The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was lewing. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza. The little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults. They were all whining and everybody said they don`t want to hear you so you had to shut up. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut. He didn`t bother to speak. Everybody were back to normal and everybody had smile on their faces and even the little kids everybody got their pizza really fast.  Always be patient."
