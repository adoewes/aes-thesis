Patience the thing going mainly tell you time and me going at and you about a time when I was patient and how I did stuff to make myself patient. One day my dad and I try out wait in the hospital to get a trip replacement and we had to sit and wait in the waiting room @CAPS2 @NUM1 hour.  I was wondering why wait @CAPS2 all time and come hand. Well thing kept telling us wait @NUM1 more hour. Anyway I hurt I quit next my mouth in the chest two hours that then I touched my chest was a look all that a sure when he∆d to ride a @CAPS1. Then after that when we had counted the circling tiles @CAPS2 @NUM3 minutes and noted that I remember them over @NUM4 tiles. That the can climb I didn∆t complain that yet at least.  After I counted the circling tiles I played @CAPS2 all with my dad I won and we ate up @NUM5 minutes @CAPS2 the rest of the time I played my @CAPS3. I played @ORGANIZATION1 and the game. I was me a while then I did it. @NUM6 more it was time to go home my dad and I was tired beyond help. I didn∆t complain once and that is the time I was patient.
