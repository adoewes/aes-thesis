"One day me and my friend @PERSON1 were at @ORGANIZATION2 and we were in the line for the @ORGANIZATION1. We ran up to the line, and we had to wait about a half hour till we got on. But the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient. After the ride we got in line for the @CAPS1! WOW! What a line, I think we were in that line for at least a hour and a half before we got on. But you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient. The @CAPS2!"
