"Being patient is a good thing to have. Let me tell you a time I was patient. Once I had a dentists apointment was @NUM1 am and my apointment was at @NUM2 am. Me and my dad sat and waited until @NUM2. It was hurting. I didn∆@CAPS1 have anything to do. I don∆@CAPS1 read magazines, they didn∆@CAPS1 have a @CAPS1.V or anything. I was really hungry because I didn∆@CAPS1 have any breakfast. @NUM4 am still in waiting. I couldn∆@CAPS1 do it. It was so bored until I remembered I had a @CAPS2  @CAPS3.S in my pocket. So I took it out and started to play it. Time went past fast. That∆s the time I was patient."
