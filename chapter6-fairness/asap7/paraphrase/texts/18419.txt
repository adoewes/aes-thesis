"A beaker bubbled in @LOCATION1 lab. I could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. ô@CAPS1 whatÆs going on!ö I yelped across the room ô@CAPS2 found the cure for the cancer!ö @CAPS3 said as @CAPS3 had a little jublee dance that @CAPS3 showed off. I am a doctor and I wasnÆt so sure but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. ô@CAPS4Æs go try it out!ö @CAPS3 screamed. As I zoomed to the car and waited while @CAPS3 packed up his lab equiptment. After @NUM1 minutes I was pondering where @CAPS3 could be. @CAPS3Æs just having a hard time packing up I said. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple hours I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping @NUM2 ? hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. ôI saved this kittenÆs life with my cure for cancer.ö @CAPS3 said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that @CAPS3 saved the kitten, my pager dinged. @PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. @CAPS3 got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @PERSON1 laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly got her heart rate down. At this moment I wasnÆt sure if she would live. ô@CAPS6 give it to her?ö the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. ô@CAPS7, not yet.ö I waited five minutes and then poured it in. @PERSON1 came back to life. Even though @PERSON1 couldnÆt talk, I could tell by her smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, ô@CAPS8 youö. I only smiled back."
