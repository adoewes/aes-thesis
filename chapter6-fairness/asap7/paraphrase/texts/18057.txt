"The place I was paitent it was at my mom∆s doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place at @LOCATION1 road and it was small and I had to wait out at the lobby and it was boring. I first started watching chanel @NUM1 news it got intrusting. Then I went at the front counter got a blue pen plank piece of paper then begun drawing when I finish drawing  it look like a car that look as, it was a far car; and then I began looking something to do. I begaing finding and finding and then ther  was a car magazine and there was cool cars low riders, exotic, costome, and more.When my mom was done I was patient and then we left home"
