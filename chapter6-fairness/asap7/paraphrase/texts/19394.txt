"Onece, when my family went to @LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log then you sit and it takes you up a hill. You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something, it takes time so you must be patient. If your not patient you probably want get to do what you wanted to do."
