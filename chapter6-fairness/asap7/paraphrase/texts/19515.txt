"I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient. My cousin was at my house and needed help on math homework. Because no one else was home, I had to help him. We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn∆t know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teuch him how to do it, and then explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three pages to do. It was almost two hours before we were done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient."
