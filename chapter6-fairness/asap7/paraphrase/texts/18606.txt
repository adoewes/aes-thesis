One day i spent a night over my bestfriends house for @NUM1 days and ended up going to school with her. Mind you all of my clothes and shoes were over her house still. I wasn∆t really able to get my clothes because right after school I went out to eat. I was really angry because I left my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes so I called her and told her to bring them to school.The next day i was really looking foward to getting them and I comforted her about it and she says she forgot so I gave her until the @DATE1 and she still didn∆t give them back. Notice I was very patient with her and this was the month of @DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @DATE2. Finally she gave the back and you will never believe that am still friends with her because my shoes were worn out and dirty but I had to realize that she∆s a good friend and im a patient person.
