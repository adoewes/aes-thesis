"One day when I was at my sisters football game. My mom droped us off at the game because she had to go to work. When I got out of the car she asked me if I had my money with me. I said no then she said your just going to be hungry. I said @CAPS1. @CAPS2 when the game started. I got really hungry. @CAPS2 I checked all of my packets, it just @CAPS2 happened that I found @NUM1 bucks. @CAPS2 I went to see how long the line was. The the was @CAPS2 long it was almost in the street. @CAPS2 I sat back down trying to let the line get shorter. But the line had gotten way longer @CAPS2 I ran in the line. I had to stand in the line for about @NUM2 mins. @CAPS2 when I finally got out of line I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. @CAPS2 she came up to us and asked me to bye her some @CAPS3 fries. I said no because the line was to long. @CAPS2 she said please! @CAPS2 I went back in line and it moved way slower. When I got back she said, what took you @CAPS2 long. I said look at the line. @CAPS2 that is one of the times I was patience."
