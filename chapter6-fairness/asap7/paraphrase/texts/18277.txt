A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn∆@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.
