"Patience is not fun butt is sometimes necessary. Im going to tell you how patience is not fun.It was a calm day at school. I was waiting for the well to ring. My friend @CAPS1 was going to finally give me an answer to my question. The question was do you love me? I couldn∆t stop thinking about it. Ring! Ring ! Ring ! Finally I could see @CAPS1 as excited as I was I rushed out the dorr. I went to his locker and he gave me a note so I read it. It said passibly maybee I like you. I was so happy. Patience is not fun, but I got an answer to my question. Next time you have to be patient just thing good thing come to those who wait."
