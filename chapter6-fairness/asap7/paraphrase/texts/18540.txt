"A time when I was patient is when it was winter time and my cousin and I really wanted to go outside. My kept saying ô@CAPS1 you will be able to go outö. My cousin was very mad, she was having a fit. I was just sitting there on my couch telling her what my mom said. After an hour past I was able to go outside, but my cousin could not. She wasnÆt being patient. That is a time when I was patient."
