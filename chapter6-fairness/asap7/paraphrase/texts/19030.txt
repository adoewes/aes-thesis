"One time when I had to be patient was when, i had to babysit. My family friend has a one year old @CAPS1 ,And I have a six year old brother .I had to babysit both of them because my mom and her boy friend were going  to have a double date with our family friends . Things were great until they left .My brother was in preschool at the time @CAPS2 they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and I had to help him. @CAPS2 I thought ok this will be easy, @CAPS2 i had him read the book and my mom told me that he knows the words @CAPS2 i won∆t have to sound out every single one, I had  to he wouldn∆t  do the work and the baby wouldn∆t quit crying and the dog wouldn∆t stop barking (he hate when babys cry) and the house was crazy! @CAPS2 i started to panic. What was I supposed to do? And I didn∆t what to ruin my mom plans and i definetly wanted to prove her wrong. @CAPS2 i calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said he told me to be patient. @CAPS2 i let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First  i read the book aloud it got both of their attention .then i  told  andi made a game out of doing the work and it was all good .Then  @CAPS4  time came @CAPS2 i made some food that we all liked and set the baby in his high chair with  his food and  gave my brother his plate i turned around and he  trowed  his plate at me  and food was everywhere! I got mad and told myself be patient, i cleaned up the mess and feed the kids and put in a movie and they all feel a sleep! I quietly, cleand up the house and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised i did it. Patence is a big part in life if you loose your temper it just makes things worse."
