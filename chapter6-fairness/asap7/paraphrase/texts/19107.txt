You got try to be patient with homework. One time when I was doing my homework I started to be inpatient. Because I was having trouble. But then my dad said he was going to help me @CAPS1 he told me to be patient. @CAPS1 I sat there and sat. And stayed patient as l long as I could then he finely helped me. I usaly get unpatient when it comes to homework or something like that. You @CAPS2 need to try your hardest to be patient.
