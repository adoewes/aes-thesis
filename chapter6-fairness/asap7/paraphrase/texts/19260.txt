"Patience is a valuable thing. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn∆t when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting."
