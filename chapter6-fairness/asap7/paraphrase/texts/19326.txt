"There is many ways to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient."
