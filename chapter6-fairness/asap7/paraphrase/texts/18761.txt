"Once there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day @PERSON1 was going to get her drivers licence. She was to and was so excited to be able to drive. When @PERSON1 got to the licence place she saw that there were a lot of  people waiting. She estimated about @NUM1 people were there, ô@CAPS1 did there have to be so many people here,öshe thought to herself. After about @NUM2 minutes of waiting she got @CAPS6 mad, because only one person got his licence in the time period. She thragh a big fit  right there. ôugghh! I was supposed to get my licence today not wait around for a bunch of experienced adults to get their licence renewed!ö she started blabbering and said. ô@CAPS1 do you guys take so long! You are so slow!ö she went home and started talking to her faend @CAPS3 on the cell phone. ô@CAPS2 there were many people I am never going to get my licence @CAPS3!ö   ô@PERSON1 just calm down. Stop being so impatient.ö  ô@CAPS4 the line was so long and . Æ @PERSON2 cut @PERSON1 off. ô@CAPS5 you keep running home crying, you will never got your license.
