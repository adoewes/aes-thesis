"Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like @CAPS1 for example. I always get up really early on @CAPS1 morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @NUM2 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @NUM4 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end."
