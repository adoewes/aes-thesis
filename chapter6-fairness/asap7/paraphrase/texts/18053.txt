"I know a girl, sheÆs my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all her veggies, does all her-home work, and has straigt AÆs. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a saterday night so it was quite busy. There was a long line to @CAPS2 the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, ô@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes.ö @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. ô@CAPS2 over it you potato sak,ö I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case senerio. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, ô@PERSON2, we gotta @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode!ö I looked at her with my, why donÆt you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 through out the night making sure she didnÆt go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didnÆt @CAPS2 kicked out. You should always @CAPS1 patient or things @MONTH1 turn out bad."
