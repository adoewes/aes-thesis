"Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not your normal. @CAPS1-@CAPS1. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help  you in the long run. I f you and I were patient our would would be a  little  bit fasier. Like  if your brother for an instint was in your bathroom and you had  to use it. you  could wait for him to finish. That is saving  argueing and it∆s  being patient. I say these thing like ÙI∆m patient!ˆ but that would be  a lie, because I am far from it! Not saying it∆s  easy but we all try."
