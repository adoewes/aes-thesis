"Just be patient lucie said to @CAPS1. I will be done soon. How soon is soon? Awile. I will be done fileing papers in about an hour then I will take you to the park an hour? that is such a long time. Just go watch tv. but I dont want to leave me alone or when I get done I wont take you to the park ok. So @CAPS1 whent and placed vidow games with his little sister @PERSON1 for awhile, and made some pizza, and then his friend from school come over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and his and his mom. So he asked lucie if he could go to the park with ryan and she said yes just be back by five o∆clock. and he and @PERSON1 had a great time. and ryans mom got them all ice cream. and he learned that being patient is very very important."
