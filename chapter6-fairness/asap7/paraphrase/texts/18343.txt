"Yester day I went to the orthodontist and waited for my check-up. @CAPS1 took a little while but @CAPS1 was my turn next. When I got home I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready, but even though @CAPS1 was only an hour until @CAPS1 would be ready @CAPS1 seemed like @CAPS1 was a life time. The delicoas aroma coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat pationtly and read my book until @CAPS1 was done. After words I was watching ghost hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with thier toys. So I had to pause the show because they cant do anything when the @CAPS2 is on. So patiently, I waited for a excruciaing @NUM1 minutes until they were done. So over all I think I was very patient yesterday."
