"It was the night before @CAPS1 eve and I couldnÆt hardly wait. In @CAPS5 family on @CAPS1 eve we go to @CAPS5 grandparents house. When we are there we talk, eat, and @CAPS5 favorite open presents. As @CAPS5 mom, dad, and I drove up to @CAPS5 grandparents house I couldnÆt open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times. ô@CAPS3 hello there, @CAPS4ö @CAPS5 grandpa said. ô@CAPS6, can we eat fast so I can open @CAPS5 presents?ö ôyah, sure.ö @CAPS7 we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldnÆt wait. As I waited patiently until all of @CAPS5 old relatives opened their presents it was finally @CAPS5 turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was a game. Since it was the first present I had to open it fast but from then on I waited paitently until it was @CAPS5 turn."
