"I am going to be writing a time when I was patient. Me and my family went to ceder point. and it was this ride called the @CAPS1 the best, and highest roller coaster at ceder point. So we got in line it was so long we had to wait @NUM1 to get on the ride, because the line was so long. So I had my uncle who wasent getting on the ride to go get me some pop, elephant ears, and some chips because I was so hungry and thirsty. So while I was being patient, my other family was not being very patient. I was the only one patient. So @NUM2 past we still in line my family started fussing. @NUM3 hrs past they were getting madder. Then @NUM4 hrs came we were starting to be able to see the roller coaster and people getting on and off. So finally, we got on the ride, we enjoyed it. Then I had to explain how patient I was.  And how unpatient they was not."
