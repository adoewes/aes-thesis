"Playing hockey is importint to me. I am a goaltender playing for farmington hills. Playing goal takes skill having ôthick skinö and most impotantly being patient. Every game day @CAPS2 dad tells me ôbe cool, calm and colectedö the three @CAPS1Æs (as I call it). I step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come @CAPS2 way. Once it does I am in action. The pirod ends and I wait patiently. The second pirod is here I stand waiting  the drop of the puck hopeing we scare. @CAPS3!!! @CAPS3!!! @NUM1 to @NUM2 @CAPS2 patientness helped itÆs @NUM1 to @NUM2! The third pirod comes @CAPS3!! Big @CAPS4 by @ORGANIZATION1 (thats me)! @CAPS3!! Goooaaalll!! @NUM5 to @NUM2. thats it the game is over! I wated patiently to get that win aganst the @LOCATION1. After the game we all go and party at @CAPS5 @CAPS6Æs house to celebrate a big win. And we all had a really great time doing it too."
