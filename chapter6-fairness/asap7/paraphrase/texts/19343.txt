"Today was the first day I was patient. I couldnÆt believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said ô@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you donÆt get this line moving then IÆm going to have to talk to the waiterger. All the guy said ôIÆm so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before youö. ô@CAPS2 are you kidding meö she yelled as she stopped way and thatÆs when I knew how ridiculous I looked when IÆm inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said ôDo deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.ö And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?ö I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that IÆm never gonna be inpatient again."
