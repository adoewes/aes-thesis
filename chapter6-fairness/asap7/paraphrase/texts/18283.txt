"One day not @CAPS1 very long ago, my brother @PERSON1, had homework troubles. And yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said ôon what.ö @CAPS1 he said ô@CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I canÆt do it.ö @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. @CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper."
