"Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed ö@CAPS3 is going to have babiesöthen I scremed with her. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk nowÆ I told my sister, @DATE1 . ôI wouldn`t doubt it,Æ said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies todayö then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. ôthen we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said ôoh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babiesö we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright.ö I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!"
