"A time when @CAPS3 parants wereÆs  patient was when I wouldnÆt @CAPS7 @CAPS3 dinner. One night @CAPS3 dad made chop soey for dinner. I didnÆt like chop soey at @CAPS1! The smell of it @CAPS2 made me gag! But, @CAPS3 dad loves chop soey  so he makes it @CAPS1 the time! We @CAPS1 sat down to @CAPS7. I ate a potato and @CAPS3 dad gave me whole scoop of chop soey. ôIÆm not gonna @CAPS7 it.ö I said. ôI hate chop soey.ö @CAPS3 dad sat patiently at the table waiting for me to @CAPS7 what was on @CAPS3 plate. ôfine,ö I said, ô IÆ@CAPS4 @CAPS7 the meat out of it.ö I took the fork and stired the chop soey around looking for the meat. After I ate @CAPS1 the meat. I said ô@CAPS5 I am done.ö @CAPS3 dad laughed at @CAPS3 stubbornness. ô@CAPS7 the vegetables out of it.ö @CAPS3 dad said. ô@CAPS9 @CAPS10! I hate celery!ö I whinned. After a half  hour of the war of wills @CAPS3 dad won. I @CAPS2 wanted to leave the table but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the chop soey and leaving the table. That was when @CAPS3 dad was very patient."
