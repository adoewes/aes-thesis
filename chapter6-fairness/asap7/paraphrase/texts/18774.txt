"When your at a store or the doctor or anywhere where you have wait for something you always have to have patience or you wiil never be able to do anything. I remember when i was at the store with my mom we had to wait in this long  line just to buy a few groceries but if didn∆t  have patience we would put are stuff back and went back home but sense we did  have patience we got to buy are stuff. That why, if you dont have you won∆t be able to do anything you wanna do."
