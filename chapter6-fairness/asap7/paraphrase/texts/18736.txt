"Every day I have to be patient, acctualy every one has to be patient. But have you ever been patient for a sibling? If so then you know how I felt when my sister didn∆t want to go out side out of her own self wanting reasons. The other day I was trying to get my sister to go out side with me because we have a special willow tree that we bang out of any way, I was getting off topic, since she kept refusing to get out and exercise I had to result to telling my mother, you can image a she didn∆t, my sister brought a book, we assign and then? We got to a??? Way??? Middle of my neighbor hood and we went separate way, I, of course, didn∆t??? this and had to waste as a friends house ??? have until she realized a want going to follow her. So IÊve been annoyed with patience, but?? ?here told it∆s a vertue so a guess??? O.k. with that."
