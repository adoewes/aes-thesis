"A A time when I was patience is when our family goes to @CAPS1 point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds)  A couple years later the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn∆t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines."
