"Two week sago meandmy family went to siyflags, for fright fest. The lines were going to be long and I would nevero be patient, I hate being patient . We went on @LOCATION1 city @CAPS1 first the lines was only ten minutes. Then the super man, that one was a little longer. Me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the riper. Then perisa wooden rollercoaster that goes of the track a lot we waited @NUM1 minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we sun the coster people with these flash passes kept coming. The flash pass takes you to the front of the line. When we fin ally got to the front of the line my patients was @CAPS2. The roller coster went off the track. It was a @NUM2 mile coster but a tur one. That is the time I was  patient."
