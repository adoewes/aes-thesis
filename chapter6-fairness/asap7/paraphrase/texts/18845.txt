"I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my room I she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma and my grandma talks a lot. It was so oganizing. For example, I kept paceing back and forth but then I just sat down. After an hour of patientience, my mom and grandma said goodbye and hung up the phone and I finally got my breakfast."
