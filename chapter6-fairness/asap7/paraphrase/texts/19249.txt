"You will say that you are board very fast. Most people are cause when you get out in the woods theres nothing you can do except watch and waist if you make one noise you will see nothing your whole hunt. Hunting is all about patients but it is a great reward when that doe, buck or whatever you∆re hunting is rite in your sight. There are sometimes that I have been impatient and there∆s times that I have been patient when I was younger I was very important I would got up and walk around but when I got older I got more patient like when. I got my first deer it was an eight point. Hunting @MONTH1 take patients but I like it and its fun."
