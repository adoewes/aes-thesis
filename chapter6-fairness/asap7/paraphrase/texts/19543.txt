Will I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that farthers day morning in @DATE1 I was so exicted. I∆m not a very patient person so when it came to this it was so hard to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard but when she was in my arms it was the must ama-zing feeling in my life. it∆s always hard having to leave her when she∆s calling your name it∆s like I want to cry. I don∆t always get to come home to a little girl saying my name but I love every minute I do. I always patiently wait to see her again but it is hard if you know what I mean.
