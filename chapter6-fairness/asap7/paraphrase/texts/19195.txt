"Click,Æ ôok, cool grandma thanks.ö  I say ôyour welcome.ö @CAPS1 says. ôWhen will they be hereö I say. ôI donÆt know.ö @CAPS2 you donÆt know what @CAPS3 talking about, which you probably donÆt, @CAPS3 talking about my shoes I just ordered online. There called @CAPS4. And boy was I goin crazy over these things. I waited for @NUM1 days and every day I would ask my mom, are they here yet, are they here yet, but every time l did, they werenÆt there. I was starting to get mad. So finally l rode my bike around to get it off my mind and I see a @ORGANIZATION1 truck and I thaught on yes hes probably going to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, and waited but still no shoes. So the next day l look up online were my shoes were, and it said @PERSON1. MI. I was flipping out that meant they were coming. So again @CAPS3 wating, and waiting and my mom decided we go somewhere. So l went in the car to leave, and I thaught l heard the truck, but nope so we finally arive back at my house and l looked to the left and yup! there they were sitting on my front ?? in a rough brown box. I run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man. I try them on (@CAPS6) they are awesome. I thank my grandma and all my patients flew away. I felt so happy."
