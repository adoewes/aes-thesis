A time I was patient was when I was going on the raptor at cedar point. There was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored. There was some music but that didn∆t really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it. One hour dragged by. Then finally ten more minutes wait till I got to go on the raptor it was the best ride ever.
