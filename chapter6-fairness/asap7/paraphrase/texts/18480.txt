"Quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me. I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when I come home. Once when we were sitting there in the living room, I was telling my mom the story. As I go on and on my mom has the patience to listen to it. Though the story @MONTH1 have been boring for her, and extremely long, she listened, she made coments and never showed a sign of boredom. The expression on her face made me happy to know she was listening."
