Patient are people who been injured in same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot. On our way out of the hospital I blacked out and hit my chin on the door so we had to stay their for about an hour. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient.
