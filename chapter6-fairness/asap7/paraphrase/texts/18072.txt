"My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 for @DATE1 break one year I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights untill we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours untill we got there. Then we checked are bags went throug securely, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours untill the plane came. Then we got off that plane we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed to! So we had to wait a few hours again untill the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride untill we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there."
