"I∆m going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy. Also my mama had to go to other places to. First, we went to costland mall to get me a homecoming dress. After that, we had to go to shoe depot get me some shoe. Third, I went to go get my hair done. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait @NUM1 min. I told my little sister @CAPS1.M.G this whole day you have been patient. I couldn∆t do that."
