"Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just @CAPS1Æt control yourself? You ask your parents, ôwhenö and they say, ôsoon just have some patience!ö well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. ôaww!ö everyone screamed. ô@CAPS1 I hold her,ö and ôsheÆs my dog,ö and ôletÆs name herö also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. ôyou are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first!ö I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!"
