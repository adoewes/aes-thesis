"To @CAPS4 being patient means to not while if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you. ThatÆs what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasnÆt going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music.ö mom that our favorite song.ö @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said ôyou have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here.ö @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. ôlets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said, ô @NUM2 hours laterö. My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. ô@CAPS8 you donÆt crack @CAPS5 its are turn to take the pictures I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal.ö @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next.ö The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. ô@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I wantö. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in there  life just like @CAPS4"
