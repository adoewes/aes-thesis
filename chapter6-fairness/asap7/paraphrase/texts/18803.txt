"My friend was waiting for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad, my dad was busy fixing his @CAPS1. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting till he fixed it. I was wondering what the question was. He was sitting inside, watching tv waiting for him to be finished. Then my dad was done so my friends asked if we could ride the @CAPS1. My dad said yes. My friend was being patient."
