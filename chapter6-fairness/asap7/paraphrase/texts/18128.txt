"My mom has very little patience, that∆s way it surprised me when she had a whole bunch the day my grandma passed away. I was amazed she was sad but took her time carefully and slowly as if every move she made had to be perfect. It was a terrible day and all any of us wanted to do was cry. My mom knew that my grandma would want her to be happy, that∆s why she watched her every move. As soon as I got there she came right up to me and gave me a huge hug and no matter what my little brother and I did she didn∆t even mind. That was a very surprising day because I had never in my life seen her that sad but yet so patient."
