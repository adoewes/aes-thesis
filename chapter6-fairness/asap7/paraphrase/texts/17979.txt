"One day I was at home and I was getting ready to go and to eat and there was a very long  line so I was on the phone with @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 we were talking about the @CAPS1 test so then I said @CAPS2 why is this taking forever so they told me to be patient and until it∆s time to order, so I said what does patient means they said it means to understand and be tolerant and do not complain so I said I might try that and then before I knew it I was sitting at a table eating and on the phone at red hobster. So now I know whenever I go somewhere with long lines all I have to do is be a lot more patient and dont complaine."
