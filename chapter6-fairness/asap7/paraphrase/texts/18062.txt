"A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually to me, a very funny way of impatience.  My classmates and I were divided into groups at differents areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification identifying the differen characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects be taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it. Our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, ô@CAPS1 @CAPS2!ö as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!"
