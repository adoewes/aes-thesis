One time I was pacient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 + cousin. I had to baby sit my cousin @CAPS2 while his room pack up cause they were making back to @LOCATION2. My cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way. But I was pacient  and waited til the trip was away. I didn∆t complain til  I got home til  my mom. Me and my cousin got in lots of fights on that vacation. But I still love him . I had to be very pacient with my cousin and even maybe do what he wanted but I knew his mom was very proud of me. I remember when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators. But then @CAPS2 wanted to go to the pack.I knew I had to give in ( considering that hes @NUM1 and immature). But I just went with the flow and we went to the pack. That was a time that I had to be pacient.
