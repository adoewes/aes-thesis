A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. @CAPS1 the party came I got all my presents∆ exept the ones from my parents. They said @CAPS1 everyone left they would give them to me. But no one left till ten. So I fell asleep. When I wook up no one was up. So I still had to wait. (I hate waiting.) @CAPS1 my mum got up I asked if I could open my presents she said wait till your father gets up. @CAPS1 my dad finally got up (@NUM1) I finally got to open my presents. It was worth the wait.
