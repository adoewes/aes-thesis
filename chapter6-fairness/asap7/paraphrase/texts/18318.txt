Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now not later. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something. If theres a test on @DATE1 .I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen. If you have patience it's almost like a gift just like singing and dancing one a gift.
