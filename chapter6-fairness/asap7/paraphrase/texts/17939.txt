"I sat there, staring off into the distance waiting for something to happen. I casually leaned back to my chair and propped my head toward the ceiling. I tried my best to clear my head and be paitient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for celar paintÆs @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and danger. The line was estimates at a two hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I wanted to ride the ride. We started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us. ô@CAPS1 is this taking so long?!ö I said impatiently. ô@CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?ö ô@CAPS3.ö  I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly scooted forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and thought of my music. I became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on. I was proud of being patient. We looked at the ride and hopped on. Patience really pays off. I learned to be patient with all sorts of things."
