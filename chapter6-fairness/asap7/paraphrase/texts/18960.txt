"Book @CAPS1 æAnd the characters lived happily ever afteràà..for now!Æ @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages weÆre left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results weÆre very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. ô@CAPS3Æs wrong!ö @CAPS11 her mom. ô@CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.ö ô@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patienceö said mom. ôPatience? @CAPS3Æs that?ö @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 ôPatience is when you wait for something, and you donÆt complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.ö ô@CAPS6 IÆm waitingö said @CAPS7 ô@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot.ö The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. ô@CAPS9ö said @PERSON2. ô@CAPS3Æs this?ö @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 ô@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12Æs checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.ö ô@CAPS13 youö said @LOCATION1. She couldnÆt belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait."
