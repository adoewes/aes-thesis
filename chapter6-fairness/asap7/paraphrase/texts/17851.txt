"Tick, tock, tick, tock. Being patient is hard for some people but easy for others. IÆm not a very patient person. IÆll tell about a time when I was patient. (the only time) One time me my mom and my sister we went to the docter because my sister had a docters appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said ôabout @NUM1 min.ö @CAPS1 I said ok. @CAPS1 we arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no IÆll wait in the car. @CAPS1 I was inside of the car waiting and I got boare  and turned  the music on and this was ??? about @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. @CAPS1 I tried to fall asleep. That didnÆt work @CAPS1 I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight. It was @NUM5 and my mom and sister come walking. Thats a time I was patient."
