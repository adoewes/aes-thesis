"To say really IÆm not a very patient person, but once I was, I donÆt really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color. So I was waiting @NUM1 minutes passed then @NUM2 then I lost track of time but I knew it was a long time. Then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people were trying to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones but as much as I wanted them I just couldnÆt wait any longer. I ô@CAPS1ö and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later we came back luckily the earphones were just where I put them. Yesss!!"
