"One time I was patient because I was hunting it was a cold @DATE1 play I am sitting in blind with my dad waiting for a deter. It`s almost eight Ùo∆ clock and we have been out there since @NUM1. We hear the ducks and geese making noises in the marshland next to us, we could see the trees dance in the wind. Smell the trash dance of grass and the morning fog. Then out at nowhere at @TIME1AM then came another doe. They went by us with caution so I got the gun ready. Then out came the eight point bunch I shot him through the heart and lung. I also gutted him. The year at @DATE2 in the youth hunt I was patient and it paid off."
