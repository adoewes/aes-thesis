"It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldnÆt go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said ôwhy did you get of line?ö ôI am scaryed.ö ô I want to go on it though.ö ô@CAPS1 you wait till later?ö I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 saidö @CAPS1 we go on the ride?ö ô@CAPS2 we @CAPS1ö my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. ThatÆs when @CAPS4 said ôI @CAPS1 wait.ö ô@CAPS3 lets get it over with.ö @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now."
