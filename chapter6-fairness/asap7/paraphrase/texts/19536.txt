"I was patient one time, really patient but kinda went like this. It was @CAPS1 and my mom a I went shoping for presents. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into target, and I already knew what I was going  to get my brother, the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 it was perfect. But my mom wouldn∆t let me buy  so I just bought him a target gift card for @MONEY1 i had to hide it for almost a month, but i really wanted to know what my mom got for my brother and I, but she wouldn∆t tell me so I  had to be patient. And when @CAPS1 came I was so suprised because my mom bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for me and my brother."
