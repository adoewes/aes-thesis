"There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve and it was about @NUM1, meaning I just woke up, I ate breakfast brush my teeth after I got out of the shower. By now I would have probably ask my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadnÆ@CAPS6 ask he once yet. I was up string playing my play station when my mom called up @CAPS2!!!! I open my door and as usual my cat was right at my door I shut my door hop over my cat get to the stairs then yell food. He sewried down the stairs and right to the canter. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a @CAPS3!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. ô@CAPS4 many times have you ask to open a present?ö ô@CAPS5ö I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 about @NUM5 minutes later I was done watch @CAPS6.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day."
