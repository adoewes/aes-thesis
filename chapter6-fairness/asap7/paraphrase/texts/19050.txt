"Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a gon??? and your not patient maugio wait  your turn here not going to hire you, here not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 but we had to leave at @DATE1 am so I couldn∆t go to sleep. I woke up at @TIME1am so I was tired. I couldn∆t take a nap because if I did the nap will turn into a deep sleep. Next I and to finish packing ?????????? so I  was really tired and  ?????????? show I was ran because it was  a hour left. When I was done packing. I started to watch t.v to keep me awake because I can∆t go to sleep under a ????????. Then   my cousin  had to have his diper changed so I was to change it, but @CAPS1 when I was @CAPS1 about to get ????????????????? called at and said Ùlet∆s go.ˆ I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van.  In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when your really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diper but some how I maintained my patience."
