"One time I was patient was in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Guess @NUM1Æs @CAPS3!) @CAPS4 was the @DATE1. When we pulled up to the tickit booth the man in the little booth said ôtickit please.ö @CAPS5 we pulled up to get a parking spot. I hen we got out & ran for the gates. But just then @CAPS8 sister forgot her towel. @CAPS5 I ran back to the truck & got @CAPS4. Then we got into our bathing sutes. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the ô@CAPS6 of @CAPS7!ö @MONTH1 I mind you @CAPS4 was very scary. But I said, ôdose any one want to go with me?ö @CAPS8 dad& @CAPS8 moms friend from work said yes! @CAPS5 we got in the line. The line was like @NUM2 to @NUM3 people in the line. @CAPS5 the wait was around @NUM4 hours! But I did not complain one bit. But then we heard a blood curtling scream from the ride. Then a man, women & @NUM4 young kids got spit out into the pool. Then we got their tube & went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening to where you could see the @NUM6 foot dropoff then the brite pink & yellow funnle. About @NUM7 minutes later we were at the port where you get on your tube. @CAPS5 we went down. @CAPS8 moms friend (@PERSON1) went down backwards. I said ôyes,ö you go to go down backwards. Halla! @CAPS5 we started going down & then we just dropped (well we freefalled) but we were going like @NUM8 mph. @CAPS4 was scary. Then we got sit out. Then I fell into the pool &got out. I scean @CAPS8 mom & was two sisters. They laughed at @PERSON1 because she was crying. Then she said she didnÆt feel good. @CAPS5 she went to the truck & took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the @TIME1. That is a time I was patient."
