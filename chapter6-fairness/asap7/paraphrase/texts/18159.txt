"A Time when I was Patient  A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; @CAPS1 were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually IÆm not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that IÆm really impatient. For some reason when IÆm really excited IÆm fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient."
