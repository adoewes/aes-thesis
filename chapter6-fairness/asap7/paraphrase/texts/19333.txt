"One time I was patient is when I went to get my hair cut and she told me to come at @TIME1. But when I got there at @TIME1, she had like @NUM1 people in front of me but I didn't care because I didn't have to do nothing after. So I was just going to sit there and be patient and I had my best friend with me so I wasn't bored and we was just sitting there talking and texting our boyfriends. So then the lady that was bout to cut my hair came to me and said I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time and I said oh it's ok l can wait. And when she got done with they hair the ladies came to me and said they was sorry. So then she had @NUM2 person left and by the time she get done be getting on like @NUM3 - @NUM4. And that was the time I was being patient."
