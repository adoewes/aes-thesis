"What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that @MONTH1 take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient. Before you be rude and keep begging for what you want think of other people, understand why it might have longer then you want and be patient."
