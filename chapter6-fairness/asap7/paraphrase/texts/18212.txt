"Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: t cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock. I just can∆t wait for class to be over most of the time. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much. I wish I was patient, but I∆m not. I∆m not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style. I don∆t think that will happen anytime soon."
