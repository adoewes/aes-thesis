"One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive threw @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ake so my ear was hearting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventully I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said ôare mom and dadö. He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reasonÆs why I had to be patient on are @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town."
