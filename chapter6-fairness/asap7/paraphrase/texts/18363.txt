"There are @NUM1 different languages in the world and different??? of these languages, in all that is  more than @NUM2 different languages. But in each language patient means the same thing, understanding and tolerant. Everyone had to be patient at one point or another, let me tell you??? one time were I was patient. It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized that we were both. I sent her e-mails, text messages, and I called her cell phone and home phone at least @NUM3 times @CAPS1 didnÆt answer or reply. I got even more frustraited the more @CAPS1 ignored me, then I talked to my cousin about it. ôYou have to be patient with her, this is your first fight.ö@CAPS1 told me in a calm voice. so, I waited by the phone to see if @CAPS1 meassaged me back without using  swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day @CAPS1 talked to me. @CAPS1 said ôIÆm sorry too, thanks for being patient with me. IÆve missed hanging out with you, how about we sit together at band?ö ôIÆd life that.ö replayed and finally made up after five days of fighting. After experience I learned that being patient   pay off. So wait your turn @NUM3 speak, and understand why people say what they say and mean what they mean. Patience is always the hey."
