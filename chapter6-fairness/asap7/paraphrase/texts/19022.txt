"One time I at the @ORGANIZATION1 thru. We had already got our food and we were waiting to get it so we could eat. We waited for about ten minutes. Then finally our food came! We looked at the food they gave us and we got all the wrong food and no drinks. So my mom had to give it all back to them.  We had to wait about fifteen minutes this time. So we waited and waited and waited. Finally they gave us our food and this time we got the store we ordered. We finally left @ORGANIZATION2 and we got to eat our food. Also we got ice cream after we ate. ""@CAPS1 the good thing is you guys were so patience. Thank you guys for being good!"" is what my mom said to us wen we got home. that is how I was patience."
