"On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to best western. The reason is that we donÆt have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, ôok, everyone back in the pool.ö I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasnÆt worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe."
