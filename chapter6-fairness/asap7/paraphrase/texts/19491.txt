I was patient last year when I was when I was taking the ??? and it was not done. I hate being patient and when I do it is boring. Patients seem like they take forever. And then people just start getting head akes and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking to much. And that is why I donÆt like being patient.
