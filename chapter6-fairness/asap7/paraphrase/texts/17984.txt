"Patience is a virture. It∆s something that we all need in life. Without it we can∆t do anything that patience. People would get boring because they have no patience. Now, here∆s a time I was patient. After @DATE1, I decided to buy on ipod touch. Since no stores were open, I had only one  other option. Online shopping. I used omazon to get it. I couldn∆t wait to yet it! Unfortunetly I had to wait like a week to get it. It was boring waiting for it, but I had other things to occupy my mind. When it finally come, I was so happy! I was glad I waited. From the patience, I learned you cant get everything rite away, I learned that people who wait, good things will come to them.Also I was better at waiting for everything. That∆s how I was patient and have bin better at being patient."
