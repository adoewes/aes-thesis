One time I had to be really patient when my grandma said there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing showed up. Then I started getting unpatient. My grandma said ô@CAPS1 keep waiting it will come soonö. So I did what my grandma said and the next day a big package came. I was so happy it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and I some new sneakers. Also we all got @NUM1 players. I was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth.
