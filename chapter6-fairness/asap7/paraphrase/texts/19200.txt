"One day my grandfather and I went fishing my grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, Ùthat will take far ever just catch some fish.ˆ I told him that was going to catch a turtle and that was final. When something pulling at my fishing rod I taint to pull it in and what pulled my line was a small white bass. The next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass. I was getting angry because there were no turtles bitting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a @NUM1 inch white bass it was the biggest fish I ever caught before but it weren∆t a turtle. After I caught that fish I said it∆s time for a break time. I was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was jacking around and catching fish. At the time I was finshing my sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling.  I had to grab my fishing rod and ??? in my fish but it weren∆t a fish it was a baby turtle."
