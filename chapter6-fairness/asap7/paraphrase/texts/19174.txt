"Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don∆t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn∆t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn∆t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4∆s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I Êm daddy∆s little girl? I think you could∆ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That∆s when daddy∆s little girl comes in handy!"
