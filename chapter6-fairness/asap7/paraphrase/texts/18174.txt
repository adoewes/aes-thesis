"Middleton middle school, IÆm one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, IÆm new here, but you @MONTH1 think that IÆm a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 IÆm not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1Æs class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. ô@CAPS2.ö @CAPS3 said. ômy nameÆs @CAPS4.ö @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. ô@CAPS2.ö I said back. ôIÆm @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.ö ô@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.ö @CAPS4 replied. ô@CAPS11 let me show you around.ö ô@CAPS12!ö I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boyÆs name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just wouldenÆt let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, ô@CAPS13Æs @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.ö ô@CAPS15?ö @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 couldenÆt do same thing. ô@CAPS16 you just donÆt have any patience!ö I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 couldenÆt understand. ô@CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1!ö @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. ô@CAPS4 wait!ö I cried but I hat to run after her. ô@CAPS20, please you donÆt get @CAPS13. You canÆt keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?ö I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. ô@CAPS21.ö @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again."
