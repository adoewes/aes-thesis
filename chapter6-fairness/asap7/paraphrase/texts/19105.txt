"One time when I was patient, I went hunting with my mom. You have to have a lot of patient to do that. When my mom and I were siting in the deer blind she was getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came. But we were siting there for about @NUM1 hours. I was about to lose my patients but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didn∆t want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone. So we waited for more deer to come in but none did. But I still had my patience in me. when it started to get cold and dark out we thought no more deer were going to come in so we just went home and plus my mom was starting to lose patient a little bit. But that∆s the time I was patient for a little while."
