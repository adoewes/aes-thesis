"I am not a very patient person ???. However there was a time to my ??? where I was extremely patient. I was in @NUM1th grade and was doing a thing called ??? Mrs. Bowos @NUM2nd grade. We would go down there ???. As you probably know, @NUM2nd graders are not very good readers but there was one girl who was not good at all. She needed ??? help from everybody @PERSON1 would sent the down in the ??? to help the girl ???. She struggled a lot and never would she rent she would shut the book as though it on the flame ???. But that was patient and everytime she ??? every time she stoped reading. I would make her keep going. Every time she out it on the floor, I would ???. Eventually the girl saw that it didn∆t accomplish anything ??? this, so, she just read. Now I was to be patient with how slow she was reading. I.P she didn∆t know a word I would help her sound it out. The girl kept getting better and better at reading until she don∆t need me anymore. But iwas proud of myself for being patient for once."
