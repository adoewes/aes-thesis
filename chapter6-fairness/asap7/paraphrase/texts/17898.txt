"If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation? In this situation I would ask for patients. I remember when I was about four or five years old. My two sister and I boreded @CAPS1 to florda. It seemed like we were sitting on the @CAPS1 for hours befor it actually took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all at the people just sitting there some were on laptops and listening to @CAPS2 players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours then I eventually fell asleep. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation? I am still not very patient, but I am more patient than I was back then."
