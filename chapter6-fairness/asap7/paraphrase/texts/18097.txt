"A time when I was patient was when I ordered a @CAPS1 in the mail. It was a cool @DATE1 @TIME1, and I was ordering a @CAPS1 online. When I got to the shipping, I paid it, and went to the check-out screen. I saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said @NUM1 weeks.ö@CAPS3?!öI exclaimed.öThatÆs a long time.ö@CAPS4 it was decided. I had to make through @NUM1 weeks. I was ready. @CAPS4 I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one @DATE2 I saw a @CAPS1. The address said ô@CAPS6 @CAPS7ö! I was @CAPS4 happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, youÆll get @CAPS3 yar wanting in the end."
