Being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION1 state game. My dad was Patient and that is unusual because he is normally in patient. So we where surprised. when we got in the stadium there was a line of people not thinking and @CAPS1 sat in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move it took about a half in hour for them to find as and again my dad was patient but the @CAPS1 at us could not wait and we started to set very angry when security got there  we had to wait for them to ghoole our rist barn he was still patient and after that we got a seats I was slat but the rezzon my dad was patient was because he did not want to get kicked out of the stadium so he stayed  patient and stayed calm.
