"The time I had to be patient was when my brother was going to get me a preasent when it wasnt even my birthday yet. This is how this whole story began. It was a hot @DATE1 day and I had been doing my chores witch include racking, mowing, and alot more yard work. Mom and dad and my brother travis had been talking alot. When I was just sitting down stairs they would tell me to to go do my chores then I could see them talking. It bothered me alot that I couldnÆt hear what they were saying. I finally just carrien on doing my chores and I just got done mowing witch took two hours and I went inside and I started to watch tv when all the sudden I hear ôclick click tap bam,ö then I heard a sudden yell of my brother travis saying ôhey get back here,ö I went to our fourteen curly stairs and all the sudden I was greeted by the licking as bbering of a six month old puppy I grabbed his collar laughing and seen his name was max and he is now a three year old happy mutt and that was my brothers preasent to me for getting all. As and doing alot of work around the house. I love my dog but that was the time I had to be patient"
