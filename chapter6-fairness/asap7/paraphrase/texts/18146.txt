"ô@CAPS1 back harder on the reighns!ö my teacher yelled ô@CAPS2 trying, but hes @CAPS8 not listening!ö @CAPS3 had to be the most stubborn horse I had @CAPS13 ridden in my life! @CAPS6 did whatever @CAPS6 wanted, whenever @CAPS6 wanted, and payed no attention to me at all. ô@CAPS4, @CAPS4 @CAPS8 bring him in.ö @CAPS6 said I slowly walked the horse into the center of the ring. ô@PERSON1, I really am trying, hes @CAPS8 not listening.ö I said ôI know @CAPS6 can be a bit hard-headed but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him.ö @CAPS3 horses name was @PERSON3, @CAPS6 was a reddish-brownish color with big glassy brown eyes. @CAPS6 looked like a great horse that listened to its rider. Wrong! @CAPS6 was not nice or sweet and didnt listen at all! ô@CAPS8 walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter.ö @PERSON1 said. ô@CAPS4 fine.ö I replied. @CAPS8 as I was halfway around the ring, @PERSON3 stopped. Then @CAPS6 turned to his right, walked up to the window and started licking the water that beaded up on it. ô@PERSON2! What is @CAPS6 doing!ö @PERSON1 yelled ôI think @CAPS6 is licking the water off the windows.ö I said ô@CAPS10 get him away from there, @CAPS6 could get sick!ö @CAPS4, as I said earlier, @CAPS3 horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! ô@CAPS8 be patient @PERSON2.ö I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I @CAPS8 needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse @CAPS13 again."
