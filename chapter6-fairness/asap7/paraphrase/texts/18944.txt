"One time I was patient. I don∆t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun."
