One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I wanted and this game that I wanted and they asked me how much is it? I said that I did not know how much it is. So he said that we would go to the store and see how much it is. When we got to there we found out that it was @MONEY2 and I said can I buy it and he said maybe after a while I started begging he still said @CAPS1! when I went home I went to sleep the next morning I was at home watching @CAPS2.V and I saw this commercially about the game and it said that the game was still @MONEY1 so I ???. When we went to the mall me saw that it was @MONEY3 and so I finally got to buy it.
