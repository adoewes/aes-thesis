"When I went to get my new phone I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a spacific person. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and me were waiting for finally came to us so we went to the phase I wanted and he talking for long time, but my grandma said if I wasn∆t patient I wouldn∆t get my new phone that day. We make it up to the counter and he∆s showing thing about the phone, I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!"
