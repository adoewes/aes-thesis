"It was blistering hot, it had already been an hour in line, ôwhen can we go?ö I asked in a moining voice. My parents replied ôjust be patient were almost at the front.ö @CAPS1, that ??? I what I did. My body ??? aching from walking around all day, but that wasenÆt going to stop me from all these rides. Ten more minutes had passed and I began to get thirsty. My @CAPS3 and sister want to go get a drink with me while my mum held our s??t in line. We made it to the booth. ôIÆll take waterö I said, ??? realived. I said thankyou, as I grabbed the ice cold water from his hands. As we all started walking back towards the line, I spotted a bright colorful shirt that said, ô@CAPS2. I couldnÆt help but ask, ô@CAPS3 can I please get this shirt?ö we still have to wait a little bit longer in the if we go back. ô@CAPS4 he responded but letÆs hurry up @CAPS1 your mom dosenÆt get impatient. After I got the shirt we walked back in the line. Thank goodness we were the second ones up. All aboard the mummy ride.ö The person controlling the ride explained. We walked on, being patient payed off, because I had a feeling this ride was going to be a blast."
