"There was a kid named @PERSON2 who was always very patient. He always waited for every else and he never complained. That morning @PERSON2 just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bath rooms were taken up but @PERSON2 didn't complain he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. @PERSON2 was a little bit late to school. The @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here and @PERSON2 put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch @PERSON2 was at the end of the line. Once @PERSON2 had gotten up there, there was no more food it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once @PERSON2 got home his family threw a patient party. @PERSON2 was honered and also happy. That night was the best for @PERSON2"
