"A time when someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have sleepover with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversery dinner. It was around @NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish @CAPS2Æs pizza. Halfway through dinner I got a text from my next door neighbor, ??? my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parent are out, theyÆll be back in a few hours, IÆll ask later. @CAPS6 finally around @NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, ôI donÆt know.ö And walked away. About a hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied ôfinally!ö @CAPS4 I had to go pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, ô@CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!ö @CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7 house she opened the door and let me in. I said, ô@CAPS8 it took @CAPS6 long. Thanks for being @CAPS6 patient!ö"
