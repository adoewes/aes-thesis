Then finally my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball an dthe offense including me ?n in on the field, and then they had me run it up the middle and I scored and then we passed it for the two point conversion and it came to me but it was high and it tipped it then it came right down in my hands and I got it but then I had to wait again because the defence ?? back in but then it was half time. I am the kick returne and we got the ball as I got the kick and returned it all the way for a touchdown and it was really cool because my tem was bleding and I broke a lot of tackles. Then it was the @DATE1 the all the other ?? we doing kneeing it and finally my ?? swotted the pass and if one a ?? the my team jumped on it and we had the ball then our full back got a pass and got the game wining touch down and thats atime when I had to be patient"
