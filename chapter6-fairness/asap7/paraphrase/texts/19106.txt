"When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times and I still donÆt understand, she helps me without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. @CAPS1 was the @DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devestated that @CAPS1 wasnÆt easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, ôturn! Turn!ö but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. ô@CAPS1Æs okay. You almost had @CAPS1!ö mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up. On my one last try before @CAPS1 was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day. She didnÆt let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!"
