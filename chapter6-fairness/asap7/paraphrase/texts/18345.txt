"This @DATE1 me, @CAPS1 mom, and @CAPS1 @CAPS2, all went to A @ORGANIZATION1Æ concert, @CAPS1 mom wasnt very excited, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was only excited just to see æ@PERSON1Æ, I was very excited just to be going  @CAPS4 we entered the parking lot to the æ@ORGANIZATION2 music  @CAPS5Æ @CAPS6 was a huge line at the door, it took up half the parking lot! But we had to wait in that line for an hour before we got in. When we got inside and to our seats. It started to rain and of course it was on outdoor concert. So by the time the opening act got done I was soaked. Then people started setting up  the stage for The æ@ORGANIZATION1Æ. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish setting up. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 mom were both getting irritated I kept waiting and staying positive. On the bright side it was an amazing concert and @CAPS7 glad I got to have the experience but next time @CAPS7  whering a hat!"
