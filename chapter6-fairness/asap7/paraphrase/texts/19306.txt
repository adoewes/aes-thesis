"Patience, whats the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that∆s the main word in my mind. Here is a story when I was very patient. Every kid dreads meap testing it was @DATE1 and we have to be completely silent. It∆s hard enough to be quite. But it∆s harder when your next to your friends, and your a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the most wrost for me. But when I was done I felt really good and quiet for everyone else. That∆s the story when I had to be patient."
