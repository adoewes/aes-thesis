"On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in little travers bay for salmon, there was a tromendus hep on the trolling line, I lanched from where I was sitting like a rocket I heaved on the line I waited. I thought it was a false alarm (snag) put trust me I thought wrong. the pull did a dance then bent realy fast again. ''@CAPS2 on,"" I yelled to my cosin, he ran back to my aid. We @CAPS4 stared at the water the poll still flexed didn't move, I was looking for the tumble weed because I felt like I was in an old western movie stand of. Finale I looked at my cousin & said, ''I have been patient, do you think I should real him up""? ""@CAPS3 me get the net first'', he fumed and grabed it then stated ""When you are ready"" I slowly cranced the handle on the real tie, tie, as I slowly cranted him from l??freaky depths. Then out of no where the steel cable that was my line shot from the ball like a bullet, but the a cyrick jerk from him and then the line went slak. My cosin & I @CAPS4 knew what had happened. the @CAPS2 I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters to flustrat more fisher men with his patient ways."
