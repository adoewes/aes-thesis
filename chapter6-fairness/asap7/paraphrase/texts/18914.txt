A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once apon a time their was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient so the hole world new her as the un patient. @PERSON1 hated that name so she though to let self and she said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I make them @CAPS3 calling me that. So @PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called the unpatient. NO body would tell her the answer so @PERSON1 sceawed out loud @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called The unpatient.  Then @PERSON1 heard a vocie it was an old man his name was @CAPS4 and he's said I no @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 @CAPS3 being called that way @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then @PERSON1 though to herself I got to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you no what she did she got in line and she was patient so when everybody went they said good job @PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her unpatient.
