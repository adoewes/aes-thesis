"A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, me and my dad ordered me an @CAPS1 girl doll. I was super excited because it was my first doll. The shipping was a problem, though. The week of my birthday. I kept waiting for the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 truck to come. I was dissapointed, because the shipped it from @LOCATION1 and it doesn∆t take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but I still wasn∆t happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom go ahed to ask when they∆re going to send it and the lady said, Ùit∆s on the way.ˆ A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up. It was worth the wait."
