"A time when I was patient was actually a few days ago. I was standing in line at @ORGANIZATION1 store with my mother so we could return abox that didn∆t work. This was the third time we have had to return these boxes. I had to stand in line for an half of an hour and watch nothing but angry coustumers. Still @CAPS1 wasn∆t our turn in line. This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all in fact he when he left he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally @CAPS1 was our turn and my mom was very patient the worker, (even though she didn∆t want to be) the worker didn∆t know what was wrong with box so she gave her a new one and we left. Being patient can bring good things just like this quote I have always like @CAPS1 says Ùgood things come to those who waitˆ @CAPS1 is very true so remember! Be patient."
