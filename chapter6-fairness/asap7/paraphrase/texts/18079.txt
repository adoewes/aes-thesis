"A time when I was patient was at @CAPS1 the largest indoor water park I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. Ê∆@CAPS2 time @NUM1∆∆our @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice but it was only @NUM2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, thats not fair I thought to my self but I knew if I wanted to make it to @CAPS1 I had to be patient and wait it out. Ê∆I have to go to the bathroom∆∆ I said in a moaning vice. Ê∆well cant you hold it?∆∆ my mother asked I∆m about to explode and your asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myelf. Ê∆ok pull over here, but it∆s gonna add to to our @CAPS2 time.∆∆  Ê∆I @CAPS4∆t core!∆∆ I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say Ê∆@CAPS2 time @NUM3.∆∆ @CAPS6 man that means no more bathroom breaks I m gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. A hour or two went by when I heard the @CAPS3  say Ê∆arive on destinaton on left∆∆  Ê∆@CAPS8!∆∆ I schreeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1 but then I saw a sign that Ê∆water park closed!∆∆ when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said Ê∆sorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow.∆∆ @CAPS9 out it was∆nt open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I could∆nt we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So at @TIME1 the park was still closed and we were checked out Ê∆I guess we can stay for the rest of the day. ll go send one more night∆∆ my dad said. Ê∆@CAPS8.∆∆ I get to go in the park! And that was the time I was patient."
